\par 
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all it
s users.  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License 
instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive sourc
e code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you mod
ify it.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so 
they know their rights.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have 
is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it
 clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.}

\par \pard\plain \s5\li283\ri0\fi0\sa115\cf0\rtlch\af1\lang255\ltrch\dbch\af10\loch\fs20\lang255 {\ltrch\loch\f1   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "wor
k based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, tra
nslation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work b
ased on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all
 the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such  interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a n
otice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
 does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply
 to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for oth
er licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be di
stributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with suc
h an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the sc
ripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts a distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under t
his License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License
.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose a
ny further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
 License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Progra
m at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain ent
irely from distribution of the Program.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, wh
ich is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he o
r she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limi
tation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later 
version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Sof
tware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.}

By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all 
its users.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for your libraries, too.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive sourc
e code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modi
fy it.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link a program with the library
, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not
 the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software.  To 
prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries.  This license is qu
ite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sens
e simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public Licens
e treats it as such.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use 
free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in th
e actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The former contains code derived from the library, while t
he latter only works together with the library.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.}

blic License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable sourc
e code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are no
t compelled to copy the source along with the object code.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Libr
ary, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library".  The executable is therefore covered by th
is License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the
 work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a d
erivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library it
self.}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit

By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all i
ts users. }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think careful
ly about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive
 source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if y
ou modify it. }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library,
 you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that t
he original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist
 that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public Licens
e. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking 
only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. The
se disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is th
at a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the w
hole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. }
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. 
}
\par {\ltrch\loch\f1 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas t
he latter must be combined with the library in order to run. }
