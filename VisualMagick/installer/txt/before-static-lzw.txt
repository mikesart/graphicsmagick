  This package includes support for the LZW compression algorithm as employed
  by GIF. UNISYS holds a patent on the LZW compression algorithm in a number
  of countries. The U.S. patent expired on June 20, 2003, the counterpart
  Canadian patent expires on July 7, 2004, the counterpart patents in the
  United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy expire on June 18, 2004, and the
  Japanese counterpart patents expire on June 20, 2004. Please be advised
  that IT MAY BE ILLEGAL TO USE OR IMPORT THIS SOFTWARE in a country where
  the patent is in effect unless you have first obtained license from UNISYS
  to do so. If you have obtained this package in a country where the UNISYS
  patent applies and you do not have a valid license, please delete the
  package immediately. The GraphicsMagick Group DOES NOT RECOMMEND,
  ENCOURAGE, OR SUPPORT THE UNLICENSED USE OF LZW in a country where the
  UNISYS patent applies. The GraphicsMagick Group does not support the
  illegal import of LZW-enabled software into a country where the UNISYS LZW
  patent applies.

Before You Start

  Please note that the user who installs this package may require
  "Administrator" privileges in order to properly GraphicsMagick.

  While multiple versions of GraphicsMagick may be installed at one time, if
  your intention is to replace a prior installation of GraphicsMagick with a
  newer version, then it may be wise to uninstall the existing GraphicsMagick
  prior to installing the newer version.

  Before installing GraphicsMagick, please make sure that you are installing the
  current release version. The current release version is posted to the site
  "http://www.GraphicsMagick.org/". Before submitting a bug report please ensure
  that you are using the current release version.
  
  While it is not a requirement, it is recommended that the Ghostscript
  package be installed. Ghostscript is available from
  "http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/". GraphicsMagick uses Ghostscript to render
  Postscript and PDF files, as well as formats where a translator to
  Postscript is available. GraphicsMagick will use the fonts delivered with
  Ghostscript to support the set of standard Postscript fonts.
  
Installation Steps

  The following describes the steps remaining to install GraphicsMagick.
  
  Select Destination Directory
  
    Specify what drive and directory to install GraphicsMagick into.
    Approximately 14MB of free disk space is required to install GraphicsMagick.
    The default installation directory is similar to
    "C:\Program Files\GraphicsMagick-1.0-Q8". Once you have entered the
    desired installation directory, then select "Next>" to continue.
  
  Select Start Menu Folder
  
    Select the folder where you would like the program's shortcuts to appear.
    The default should normally be satisfactory. Click on "Next>" to continue.
  
  Select Additional Tasks
  
    A screen is displayed which provides the following options

      o Create a desktop icon

        This option adds an icon to the desktop for GraphicsMagick's
        display program.

      o Update executable search path

        This option adds the GraphicsMagick installation directory to the
        executable search path.

      o Associate supported file extensions with GraphicsMagick

        Regardless of this setting, formats which are invented by GraphicsMagick
        will be associated with GraphicsMagick. If this box is checkmarked, then
        *all* image formats that GraphicsMagick supports (including popular
        formats like GIF, JPEG, TIFF, PDF, and Postscript) will be associated
        with the GraphicsMagick display program. Please consider carefully if
        you want to do this!

      o Install ImageMagickObject OLE Control

        This option registers the ImageMagickObject DLL as an OLE Control to
        support use from languages which support using COM objects.

    Please ensure that you are satisified with your selections prior to
    continuing.
  
  Ready to Install
  
    A screen is displayed which displays the selected options. If you are not
    satisfied with a selected option, then click on "<Back" to go back to a
    previous screen so that the option may be adjusted. If you are satisfied
    with the options and are ready to install, then select "Install". To
    abort the installation entirely, select "Cancel".
  
  Installation Progress
  
    While the install program is performing the installation, it will display
    what it is doing in an installation progress window.
  
  Finishing Up
  
    By default "View index.html" is check-marked. This causes the
    GraphicsMagick web pages to be displayed in a browser when "Finish" is
    selected. If you do not want to view the web pages, then de-select
    "View index.html". Select "Finish" to exit the installation program.
    Under Windows '95 and Windows '98 it will be necessary to reboot the
    system in order for some settings to take effect (such as executable
    search path) since these are set in autoexec.bat.  It is advisable to
    inspect the contents of autoexec.bat before rebooting to ensure that
    the path has been updated correctly.
  
  Testing The Installation
  
    Select "Command Prompt" from the Windows Start menu. Within the window type
    
      gm convert logo: logo.miff
      gmdisplay logo.miff
    
    and the GraphicsMagick logo should be displayed in a window.
