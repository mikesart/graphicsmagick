You have now installed GraphicsMagick. To test the installation select "Command
Prompt" from the Windows Start menu. Within the window type
    
        gm convert image:logo logo.miff
        gmdisplay logo.miff
    
and the GraphicsMagick logo should be displayed in a window.

If you selected to create a desktop icon, an icon labeled "GraphicsMagick
Display" will appear on your desktop. Double clicking brings up GraphicsMagick's
image display program. Please be patient with us. The image display program
is still very much under development.

For your convenience, the full content of the GraphicsMagick web site has been
installed on your computer. This is available from the Windows start menu via
"GraphicsMagick 1.0" -> "GraphicsMagick Web Pages".

For C and C++ developers who would like to be able to use the DLLs provided
with this package, link libraries and header files are provide in the 'lib'
and 'include' subdirectories of the installation directory. Demonstration
project files and source files for Magick++ may be found in the Magick++_Demo
subdirectory. Build these via the Magick++_Demo.dsw workspace file.
