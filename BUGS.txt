Known Bugs in development GraphicsMagick 1.2
============================================

 * PSD reader is not working for some files. Can fix by extracting the
   already rendered image from the PSD file rather than the layers.

 * Scitex reader is not working for some files.

 * BMP reader is not working for some obscure low-color packed files.

 * PCD reader is broken in 1.2.  Works in 1.1.X.

 * Kodak legacy Cineon "4.5" format support is mostly broken.

 * "gm convert logo: logo%n.png" produces a segmentation fault.

 * "gm convert * jpeg:foo" crashes.

   This is an obscure bug in which bad things happen if multiple frames are
   written to a JPEG file with no extension.
