<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-seri">Recently,
features have been added to <SPAN LANG="en-US">GraphicsMagick</SPAN>
to make it more suitable for processing images used by the motion
picture (film and high-definition) industry. In particular,
industrial strength support for <A HREF="http://www.smpte.org/" TARGET="_top">SMPTE</A>
DPX Version 2.0 (SMPTE 268M-2003) has been added for GraphicsMagick
1.2. A new Cineon Log colorspace has been added to support images
which use a logarithmic density encoding (with range of 0 to 2.048)
according to Kodak specifications for Cineon Log.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-seri">The modern
motion picture industry usually shoots on film and then uses a
machine known as a &ldquo;datacine&rdquo; or a &ldquo;scanner&rdquo;
to convert each film image into an individual image file. An
alternative to this is to use a high definition CCD camera such as
the <A HREF="http://www.grassvalley.com/products/cameras/viper/" TARGET="_top">Thompson
Viper</A> to capture images to uncompressed files directly. A rather
inferior approach is to use a video high definition compressed format
like HDCAM and convert each frame to a file for processing. Images
scanned from film are usually in either a log colorspace similar to
Cineon Log (10 bits per sample is most common), or in a linear format
(16 bits per sample is common). Some images (such as from the
Thompson Viper) are log encoded using the full range for normal
content rather than part of the range as is done for Cineon Log.
While there is some continued use of the legacy Kodak Cineon format
due to existing equipment and software, the standard image file
format for motion picture frames is SMPTE DPX (SMPTE 268M-2003). This
format is similar to the Kodak Cineon format, but has the advantage
that it is an industry standard rather than a vendor standard. DPX
files are practically always uncompressed. The design of DPX places
header content at fixed offsets, and the image raster data offsets
may be computed, so DPX files may be read or updated without
rewriting the entire file.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-seri">Film images are
usually captured at &ldquo;2K&rdquo; resolution, &ldquo;4K&rdquo;
resolution, or even &ldquo;6K&rdquo; resolution, where the actual
resolution values approximate the horizontal dimension of the image.
A table of <A HREF="http://www.surrealroad.com/digital/index.php/archives/2005/standard-data-resolutions/" TARGET="_top">typical
pixel resolutions for various film sizes</A> may be found on the
<A HREF="http://www.digitalintermediates.org/" TARGET="_top">Digital
Intermediates</A> site. File sizes may be quite large and range in
size from 8MB to as much as 180MB. The common 10-bit &ldquo;2K&rdquo;
format consumes 12MB of disk. A typical movie has an average of 144K
frames (at 24 frames per second) so just one movie consumes <SPAN LANG="en-US">terabytes</SPAN>
of storage. Businesses which specialize in handling digital
intermediates often have several hundred <SPAN LANG="en-US">terabytes</SPAN>
of on-line storage available. While &ldquo;2K&rdquo; has been the
standard working resolution due to storage requirements and
processing time, recently there is a trend to scanning at &ldquo;4K&rdquo;
resolution since most experts say that this is the resolution
necessary to capture the full resolution of a 35mm frame (but some
claim more!). Some shops scan at &ldquo;4K&rdquo; but then reduce the
image to &ldquo;2K&rdquo; as the working format so that the full
resolution is available for later use, but the processing of the
feature may be done on a normal &ldquo;2K&rdquo; schedule. IMAX
(large format) film is normally scanned at &ldquo;6K&rdquo;
resolution.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-seri"><FONT SIZE=3>The
end result of the effort of encoding motion picture images to digital
image files is to have a digital master which does not degrade over
time and which has captured the maximum available information from
the original film print. This digital master may be targeted toward
producing film prints for showing in a theater, used to create <SPAN LANG="en-US">DVDs</SPAN>,
used as a master for &ldquo;digital cinema&rdquo; for viewing in
suitably equipped theaters, or used to support television broadcasts.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-seri"><FONT SIZE=3>Processing
film images is a specialty business. Many business exist which offer
specialized software and hardware to process film images. Common
tasks are &ldquo;color grading&rdquo; (adjusting color for a correct
film print), dust busting, and compositing. While GraphicsMagick
could (with some effort) be used to accomplish many of these things
it can never expect to compete in these specialized areas.
GraphicsMagick lacks the high-quality graphical user interface
necessary for a colorist or artist to interact with a sequence of
images. GraphicsMagick lacks the experienced and dedicated team
necessary to assure the desired results with particular media.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-seri"><FONT SIZE=3>The
strength of GraphicsMagick <SPAN LANG="en-US">Vs</SPAN> specialized
proprietary software are its cost (absolutely free!), open source
availability (user is able to fix software flaws or tailor software
to meet specific needs), general purpose image processing
capabilities, deep image capabilities (up to 32-bits per sample),
excellent performance, platform independence, lack of encumbering
usage licenses, and robust implementation. Examples of areas where
GraphicsMagick may be used are:</FONT></FONT></P>

<P>GraphicsMagick performs well as compared with other software.
Since it is free and portable, it may be installed on any available
system with no license fees. For example, if a business has a
computing cluster of several hundred Linux, SGI IRIX, or Mac OS X
systems, then GraphicsMagick be installed across all systems and used
for any desired purpose.</P>
<P><SPAN LANG="en-US">GraphicsMagick's</SPAN> DPX file format support
is rather comprehensive. In many ways, it goes beyond the DPX format
support in other applications by striving to implement the complete
DPX specification rather than just a few commonly used sub-formats.
The capabilities of GraphicsMagick's DPX support are as follows:</P>
<P><B>Supported DPX features:</B></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Anything which can be read, can also be written.</P>
	<LI><P>All DPX header information (including the user specific area)
	are stored as image attributes and restored when the image is
	written.</P>
	<LI><P>Image source header information is updated appropriately.</P>
</UL>
<P><B><SPAN LANG="en-US">Colorspaces</SPAN></B>:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Linear RGB</P>
	<LI><P>Cineon Log RGB (density range = 2.048)</P>
	<LI><P>Grayscale (<SPAN LANG="en-US">Luma</SPAN>)</P>
</UL>
<P><B>Storage</B>:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Bits per sample of 1, 8, 10, 12, and 16.</P>
	<LI><P>Packed, or fill type A or B for 10/12 bits.</P>
	<LI><P>All RGB-oriented element types (R, G, B, A, RGB, RGBA, ABGR).</P>
	<LI><P>Planar (multi-element) storage fully supported.</P>
	<LI><P>Alpha may be stored in a separate element.</P>
	<LI><P>Big and little <SPAN LANG="en-US">endian</SPAN> storage.</P>
</UL>
<P><B>Yet to be supported:</B></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Video <SPAN LANG="en-US">colorspaces</SPAN> like <SPAN LANG="en-US">CbYcr</SPAN>
	and <SPAN LANG="en-US">CbCR</SPAN> and composite video.</P>
	<LI><P>Floating point formats (32 and 64 bits)</P>
	<LI><P>Depth channel (not supportable within GraphicsMagick).</P>
</UL>
<P>The software is written efficiently so the performance when
reading and writing files is limited by the performance of the file
I/O subsystem. The software is designed to avoid seeking while
reading and writing so that files may be read and written over pipes,
or via a user provided file descriptor.</P>
<H2>GraphicsMagick In Use</H2>
<P>GraphicsMagick is easy to use. The following is an example of
scaling a &ldquo;4K&rdquo; 16 bit scan to a &ldquo;2K&rdquo;
<SPAN LANG="en-US">&ldquo;Academy&rdquo;</SPAN> 10 bit image:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">   gm convert 4k.dpx -resize 1828x1556 -depth 10 2k.dpx</PRE><P>
The above example uses the default resizing filters which are
optimized for quality, but take longer than some other filers. The
&ldquo;box&rdquo; resize filter provides reasonably good scaling in a
reasonable amount of time:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">   gm convert 4k.dpx -filter box -resize 1828x1556 -depth 10 2k.dpx</PRE><P>
The above example command takes about 5 seconds (on an Apple 2.5GHz
G5 PowerMac or Intel 2.4GHz <SPAN LANG="en-US">Xeon</SPAN>) to
down-convert from a 131MB &ldquo;5K&rdquo; (5232x4376) original
16-bit scan from a <A HREF="http://www.filmlight.ltd.uk/northlight.html" TARGET="_top"><SPAN LANG="en-US">NorthLight</SPAN>
scanner</A> to a 11MB &ldquo;2K&rdquo; 10-bit working image.
Operations on more typical &ldquo;2K&rdquo; images take on the order
of half a second.</P>
