(0.8.5)<BR>
<UL>
  <LI> Headers are now installed under prefix/include/Magick++ on Unix
    systems with the exception that Magick++.h is installed under

    (the documented approach) should not be impacted.
  <LI> Image constructors to construct an image from a BLOB.
  <LI> Image read and write methods to decode and encode images stored in a
