2010-02-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* doc/imdoc2man: Bare single quotes at the beginning of a line
	need to be escaped in order to make roff happy.  Problem reported
	by Daniel Kobras.

	* magick/command.c (ImportImageCommand): Don't assign a pointer to
	static constant data into an array which uses heap allocated data.
	Avoids a "double free" error when using gm import -frame.  Patch
	by Daniel Kobras.

	* magick/color_lookup.c (QueryColorname): XPM does not support
	RGBA color syntax, but it does support RGB.  Patch by Daniel
	Kobras.

	* magick/blob.c (OpenBlob): Only form multi-part filename when
	required.

	* magick/display.c (MagickXDisplayImage): The display '-update'
	option was only working in conjunction with the '-delay' option
	with a delay setting of 2 or greater.  Problem reported by Sami
	Liedes.  Patch by Vincent MAUGE.  Resolves Debian bug ID 414779.

2010-02-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/blob.c (OpenBlob): Only apply scene substitution to
	the filename if adjoin is false.

	* magick/constitute.c (WriteImage): If adjoin is true, then
	restore original filename specification since opening the blob
	modifies it.  Resolves Debian bug ID 552998.

	* magick/image.c (SetImageInfo): Don't check filename for scene
	substitution if adjoin is intentionally false.  This allows saving
	to file names which look like they contain a scene substitution
	pattern.

	* magick/command.c (MogrifyImage): Convolution failure results in
	a crash rather than an error report.  Resolves Debian bug ID
	539251.

	* magick/deprecate.c: The string constants LoadImageText,
	SaveImageText, LoadImagesText, and SaveImagesText should have been
	deprecated, rather than being entirely removed.

2010-01-31  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* www/Makefile.am (install-data-html): Make sure that only the
	necessary documentation files are installed.

2010-01-30  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* VisualMagick/installer/inc/body.isx: Strip out executable
	components which depend on proprietary MFC and ATL libraries.
	This means that "gmdisplay.exe" and "ImageMagickObject" are no
	longer distributed or installed via the Windows setup installer.
	When a new display application is developed based on open source
	libraries, then the display functionality and associations can be
	restored.

2010-01-28  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/transform.c (FlattenImages): Apply the image background
	color under the initial canvas image if it is non-opaque.

	* magick/composite.c (MagickCompositeImageUnderColor): New private
	function to apply a color underneath a non-opaque image.

2010-01-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/prefetch.h: New header to provide wrapper macros for
	compiler-specific explicit prefetch APIs.

	* magick/effect.c (BlurImageScanlines): Solid color images which
	only differed in the matte channel were not being blurred.

	* magick/color.h (NotPixelMatch,PixelMatch): New macros to
	fully-compare a pixel, including matte.

	* magick/resource.c (SetMagickResourceLimit): Invoke
	omp_set_num_threads() to set thread limit if ThreadsResource is
	requested.

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (AllocateThreadViewSet): The number of
	cache views to allocate needs to be obtained from
	omp_get_max_threads().  Otherwise there is a crash if the number
	of threads is reduced from the original value.

2010-01-20  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* www/benchmarks.rst: Update benchmark report to compare
	performance with ImageMagick 6.5.8-10.

2010-01-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/shear.c (RotateImage, ShearImage): Ensure that errors
	propagate up to the API user.  Don't overwrite a detailed
	exception message with a generic one.  Don't return a bogus image
	if there is an error.

2010-01-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* VisualMagick/installer/inc/files-base.isx: Third party
	executables not included in the Visual Studio build are no longer
	bundled in the GraphicsMagick installer.  This means that
	hp2xx.exe, mpeg2dec.exe, and mpeg2enc.exe are no longer
	distributed.

	* www/Magick++/Image.rst: Emphasize that InitializeMagick() MUST
	be invoked, and make sure that all of the examples show use of it.

2010-01-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/delegate.c (InvokeDelegate): Use MagickSpawnVP() under
	Windows as well.
	(InvokePostscriptDelegate): Use MagickSpawnVP() under Windows as
	well.

	* magick/utility.c (MagickSpawnVP): Moved from unix_port.c.
	Updated implementation to use spawnvp() rather than fork()/exec()
	under Windows.

	* configure.ac: Add check for Windows spawnvp function.
	Add check for process.h.

	* magick/semaphore.c (DestroySemaphore): POSIX mutex statically
	initialized via PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER should not be destroyed.

	* configure.ac: DisableSlowOpenMP is now the default.  Use
	--enable-openmp-slow to enable OpenMP for algorithms which
	sometimes run slower rather than faster.

2010-01-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/version.h.in: Added MagickLibInterfaceNewest and
	MagickLibInterfaceOldest preprocessor defines so that applications
	may easily test for library versions while compiling.

2010-01-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/render.c (DrawPolygonPrimitive): Use restrict keyword.

	* magick/pixel_iterator.c: Use restrict keyword.

	* utilities/Makefile.am: Modules are supported in the shared
	library built so list-module.sh test should be expected to pass.

	* configure.ac: Add WITH_SHARED_LIBS conditional.

2010-01-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/version.h.in: Update copyright years.

	* magick/semaphore.c: The return code from all pthread mutex APIs
	are now checked (not just initialize and destroy), and any error
	results in an immediate fatal exit.
