	* magick/delegate.c (InvokeDelegate): Fix memory leak of argument
	list when invoking external program via MagickSpawnVP().

2015-01-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/resource.c (InitializeMagickResources): Base image width
	and height default limits on the range of a 32-bit signed integer,
	even for 64-bit builds.  These limits are still beyond what most

	* coders/sun.c (ReadSUNImage): There is no definition for Sun map
	type RMT_RAW so it can not be supported.  Update DirectClass
	pixels directly rather using SyncImage().  Problem was reported by
	Jodie Cunningham.

2015-01-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/pict.c (ReadPICTImage): Fix PICT reader crash when
	reading corrupted file.

	* coders/sun.c (ReadSUNImage): Sun reader was still not as robust
	as it should be.  Now it is.

2014-01-10 Fojtik Jaroslav  <JaFojtik@seznam.cz>

	* coders/wpg.c Fixed reading behind EOF issue.

2015-01-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/dpx.c (LSBPackedU32WordToOctets): Fix typo which adds
	severe corruption to encoded little-endian 32-bit packed output.
	The good news is that since the corruption is severe, it is easily
	visually detected.  The problem has corrupted all such
	(little-endian 10-bit) output since it was originally implemented
	on 2007-06-17 (changeset 11686, first released in GraphicsMagick
	1.1.8).  GraphicsMagick preserves the endianness of input DPX
	files by default, defaults to big-endian, and DPX files are
	commonly big-endian, so this problem may not have occured for many
	usages.  Problem was reported by Steve Dabner on the
	GraphicsMagick discussion mailing list.

2015-01-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/magick.c (MagickPanicSignalHandler): Print a message in
	the case of signals SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ.

	* coders/bmp.c (ReadBMPImage): Don't hang in endless loop if EOF
	is encountered while checking for "BA" header.

	* coders/icon.c (ReadIconImage): Limit icon image allocation size.

2015-01-04  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/icon.c (ReadIconImage): Removed all of the
	previously-existing DIB reading code from icon.c and use new
	"ICODIB" reader to read DIB icons, or the PNG reader to read PNG
	icons.

	* coders/dib.c (ReadDIBImage): Added an "ICODIB" coder for
	internal use which reads a Windows BMP 3 DIB followed by a Windows
	ICO alpha mask.  This allows existing DIB code to be used to read
	ICO directory entries.

2015-01-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/icon.c: The Windows ICO reader is now more robust.  Still
	a work in progress since some files still can not be read or read
	incorrectly.

2015-01-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/resource.c (ListMagickResourceInfo): "kilo" for binary
	prefixes is supposed to be "Ki".

	* magick/utility.c (FormatSize): "kilo" for binary prefixes is
	supposed to be "Ki".

2015-01-01  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c: Use WidthResource and HeightResource instead
	of fixed 1-million limit for rows and columns.

2015-01-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/utility.c (FormatSize): Add 'i' to value range
	identifiers since these are all in units of 2^10 rather than 1000.

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (CheckImagePixelLimits): Fix typo and
	produce an informative error message.

	* magick/resource.c: Added support for Image width and height
	pixels resource limits.

	* magick/resource.h (ResourceType): New resource enumerations
	WidthResource and HeightResource.

	* magick/enum_strings.c (StringToResourceType): Added support for
	parsing '-limit Width' and '-limit Height'.

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (CheckImagePixelLimits): New function to
	test image to see if it exceeds pixels limits.

	* coders/viff.c (ReadVIFFImage): Make the VIFF reader robust with
	detecting and reporting problems.

	* Rotate Changelog for new year.  Update documentation copyrights
	for new year.
