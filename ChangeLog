	* magick/command.c (VersionCommand): WebP support is included in
	-version output.

	* coders/webp.c: WebP coder identifies library version and header
	ABI versions. Improve WebP error reporting.

2014-04-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (WriteTIFFImage): Allow specifying the TIFF image
	software tag.  In the special case that the string length is zero
	(e.g. -set software '') then the tag is skipped entirely.  This is
	to support SourceForge feature request #37 "Option to prevent
	addition of Exif Software tag" opened by Jean-Louis Grall.  Please
	note that this tag is not an EXIF tag.

	* magick/command.c: composite, convert, display, mogrify, and
	import now support +set to remove an existing image attribute.

2014-03-16  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c: Don't block threads when PNG_SETJMP_SUPPORTED is
	not enabled.

	* coders/png.c: Changed prefix of macros defined in coders/png.c
	from PNG_ to GMPNG_.  PNG_ is reserved for macros defined by
	libpng.

2014-03-16  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/blob.c: Don't use setvbuf() to set stdio block size if
	filesystem block size is zero (e.g. MAGICK_IOBUF_SIZE=0)

2014-03-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* tests/{rwblob.tap, rwfile.tap}: Added tests for WEBP.

	* tests/{rwblob.c, rwfile.c}: Add lossy hint for WEBP.

	* coders/webp.c (WriteWEBPImage): Fix inverted return status.
	Added a tiny bit of logging.

2014-03-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* ttf: Updated FreeType to release 2.5.3 of March 6, 2014.
	Provides security fixes for CVE-2014-2240.

	* jpeg: Update to libjpeg 9a of 19-Jan-2014.

	* png: Update to Libpng 1.6.10 - March 6, 2014.

2014-03-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/nt_base.c (NTResourceToBlob): According to Microsoft
	Report article 193678 (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/193678),
	FreeResource() is not needed in WIN32 and performs no useful
	function.  Remove use of it.  Also remove use of UnlockResource()
	which is similarly unuseful for WIN32.

	* configure.ac (MAGICK_LIBRARY_REVISION): Test for Windows
	_aligned_malloc() is not reliable.  Use Windows CRT version to
	decide if it is available.

2014-03-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/studio.h: Make sure that Windows _aligned_malloc() is not
	used under MinGW unless the CRT version allows it.

2014-02-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (InterpolateViewColor): Applied patch by
	Troy Patteson plus fixes to ignore opacity channel if image matte
	is false.  Replaces most of the code rewritten on 2014-02-16 and
	which produced a faint darkened border.  The results look stellar
	now.

2014-02-24  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/shear.c: Applied patch by Troy Patteson to improve
	non-integral rotation by around 40% by minimizing added image
	borders.  This may cause small differences in results for some
	images.

	* reference/filter/Rotate10.miff: Update rotate 10 degrees
	reference image so that PerlMagick test passes.

	* magick/shear.c: Applied patch by Troy Patteson to fix
	SourceForge issue #260 "Rotation exhibits clipping/shearing errors
	for short wide images at some angles".

2014-02-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* doc/options.imdoc: Fix documentation to note that 'unspecified
	alpha' is the GraphicsMagick default when writing TIFF rather than
	'associated alpha'.  Much thanks to Mats Peterson for alerting us
	of this error.

2014-02-16  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (InterpolateViewColor): Added a hack so that
	affine transformations and displace composite do not have
	background colored fringing on the transferred image edges when
	the background is completely transparent.  Fringing problem was
	caused by one or more of the line ends being a transparent pixel
	outside of the bounds of the original image content.  May not be
	the final solution.

2014-02-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/semaphore.c (AcquireSemaphoreInfo): Document that this
	function was deprecated.
	(LiberateSemaphoreInfo): Document that this function was
	deprecated.

2014-02-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/psd.c (RegisterPSDImage): Set PSD to UnstableCoderClass
	since its implementation is currently rather marginal.  It may
	even be that this coder deserves to be marked with the new
	BrokenCoderClass.  We are still looking for a volunteer to iron
	out the wrinkles in the PSD reader.

	* magick/magick.h (CoderClass): Added BrokenCoderClass to mark
	coders which often malfunction or are not very useful in their
	current condition.  Sometimes there is still hope that problems
	will be resolved and so the source file is not outright deleted.
	This setting allows us to mark and use coders which might
	malfunction by defining MAGICK_CODER_STABILITY=BROKEN in the
	environment while not causing danger for normal use.

2014-02-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* wand/magick_wand.c: Documentation improvements for
	MagickSetInterlaceScheme() and MagickSetImageInterlaceScheme().
	Resolves SourceForge bug #262 "setImageInterlaceScheme doesn't
	make image progressive".

2014-02-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/{ps.c, ps2.c, ps3.c, pdf.c}: Only use resolution from
	image or -density if units was properly specified.  Without units,
	resolution is worthless.

	* coders/ps3.c (WritePS3Image): Use image resolution similar to PDF
	changes.

	* coders/ps2.c (WritePS2Image): Use image resolution similar to PDF
	changes.

	* coders/ps.c (WritePSImage): Use image resolution similar to PDF
	changes.

	* coders/pdf.c (WritePDFImage): Use resolution from image if it
	appears to be valid.  Resolves SourceForge issue #261 "PNG Pixel
	Density Not Preserved Converting to PDF".

	* magick/enum_strings.c (StringToResolutionType): New function to
	convert ResolutionType to C string.
	(ResolutionTypeToString): New function to convert from C string to
	ResolutionType.

2014-02-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* wand/magick_wand.c (MagickGetImageGeometry): New function to get
	the image geometry string.  This function and the three others in
	this change set are contributed by Sara Shafaei.
	(MagickGetImageMatte): New function to read the image matte
	(opacity) channel enable flag.
	(MagickSetImageGeometry): New function to set the image geometry
	string.
	(MagickSetImageMatte): New function to set the image matte
	(opacity) channel enable flag.

2014-01-31  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* wand/magick_wand.c (MagickDrawImage): Remove development debug
	fprintf which causes each drawing primitive to be printed to
	stderr.

2014-01-21  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/pnm.c (ReadPNMImage): Fix scaling of alpha in sub-ranged
	pixels.  Addresses SourceForge issue #237 "Incorrect MAXVAL
	scaling when reading PAM images", which was not fully fixed in by
	the previous attempt.

2014-01-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/tsd.c: Implement TSD for "pure" OpenMP mode without
	relying on POSIX or WIN32 TSD APIs.

	* magick/semaphore.c: Implement OpenMP-based locking so that code
	can compile in a "pure" OpenMP mode without relying on POSIX or
	WIN32 locking APIs.

	* configure.ac: --without-threads no longer disables use of
	OpenMP.  Use the already existing option --disable-openmp to
	disable OpenMP.

2014-01-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/common.h: Support use of clang/llvm __attribute__ and
	__builtin extensions similar to the existing support for GCC.

2014-01-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Magick++/lib/Image.cpp (thumbnail): New method for fast image
	resizing, particularly to make thumbnails.

	* coders/gif.c: Log when Netscape loop exension is read and
	written.

	* coders/png.c (WriteOnePNGImage): In optimize mode, disable matte
	channel immediately if there are no non-opaque pixels.  Also added
	some useful logging.  Resolves SourceForge issue #252 "convert an
	8bit PNG result in a corrupted image ".

	* wand/magick_wand.c (MagickSetImageGravity): New Wand method to
	set image gravity.
	(MagickGetImageGravity): New wand method to get image gravity.

2014-01-02  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c (ReadOnePNGImage): Use libpng function
	png_set_strip_16_to_8() when scaling 16-bit input PNG down to
	8-bit in a Q8 build.  The png_set_scale_16_to_8() function is
	more accurate, but the slight difference causes reference tests
	to fail and causes unexpected difference between the behavior
	of PNG and other formats.  If png_set_strip_16_to_8() is not
	supported in libpng, then we use png_set_scale_16_to_8() if
	that is available.
