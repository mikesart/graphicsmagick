	* coders/pnm.c (ReadPNMImage): Support for multi-frame PNM was
	botched due to on-going edits to support PAM format.

	* wand/magick_wand.c (MagickDescribeImage): Was sending
	descriptive output to stdout rather than returning it in an
	allocated string as intended.

	* magick/draw.c, wand/drawing_wand.c (MvgPrintf): Update to handle
	C99 vsnprintf() return values.

	* magick/draw.c, wand/drawing_wand.c (DrawAnnotation): Linux
	glibc does not pass extended text characters if "%.1024s"
	formatting convention is used.  Apparently it assumes that such
	characters may be UTF8 and returns -1 rather than outputting the
	string, even if it is assured to fit.
