	* coders/png.c (ReadOnePNGImage): Respect the PixelsResource
	limit.

	* coders/png.c (ReadOnePNGImage): Moved quantum_scanline
	and png_pixels into the MngInfo struct.  This prevents
	memory leaks when reading malformed PNG images, but unfortunately
	triggers a new complaint about a possible race condition.

	* coders/png.c (ReadOnePNGImage): Removed two superflous calls to
	CloseBlob().

	* coders/png.c (ReadOnePNGImage): Do the allocation and free of
	quantum_scanline outside the "pass" loop, i.e., do it once per

	images.  Log these when -debug coders is enabled.

	* coders/png.c: Fixed typo recently introduced in the JNG reader
	(status != MagickFalse should be status == MagickFalse).

	exceptions (e.g. warnings) thrown earlier.

	* coders/bmp.c (ReadBMPImage): Detect 32-bit integer overflows and
	other annoyances caused by intentionally broken files.  Also, only
	warn if the file header claims the file is larger than it is since
	this is a benign issue.

	* magick/blob.c (OpenBlob): Fix "magic header bytes" log message
	count value.

2015-02-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* NEWS.txt: Updated NEWS with more changes.

	* Magick++/lib/Magick++/Include.h (Magick): Add GetImageGeometry

	* magick/attribute.c (GenerateEXIFAttribute): Fix crash while
	parsing corrupt EXIF which was reported by Stijn Sanders on
	2015-02-17.

	* Magick++/lib/{Blob.cpp, Image.cpp}: Incorrect lock scope
	resulted in Magick++ locking not actually working to protect
	critical sections in spite of no detected problems with locking
	these past 16 years.  Problem was detected using the
	misc-unused-raii check from clang-tidy and was reported by Hyrum
	Wright.

	* coders/palm.c (ReadPALMImage): Add header logging to writer.
	Writer still seeks and overwrites its own header so logging is not
	entirely accurate yet.

	* Magick++/lib/Image.cpp (Image::quiet()): Patch by Dirk Lemstra
	to support silencing warnings in Magick++.  Adds a quiet() method
	which blocks (ignores) warning exceptions when passed a true
	argument.  Warning exceptions are still generated by default.

	* coders/tiff.c: Support '-define tiff:report-warnings=true' to
	enable that warnings reported by libtiff are thrown as warning
	exceptions so that they may be caught or will be reported at the
	gm command-line.

	unitialized data.

	* coders/jpeg.c (ReadJPEGImage): Verify that we support the number
	of output components before proceeding to decode the image.

2015-01-25  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/miff.c (ReadMIFFImage): MIFF needs to stop spinning if

	not return a value if it does not return.

	* magick/error.c (DefaultFatalErrorHandler): Invoke
	PanicDestroyMagick() rather than DestroyMagick().  If we are
	really that short on memory, DestroyMagick() might not work.

	* magick/magick.c (MagickPanicSignalHandler): Only use async-safe
	functions in signal handler.
	(PanicDestroyMagick): New function for emergency release of
	persistent resources just prior to program exit.  Async-safe and
	does not acquire or release any heap memory.

	accidentally shortened by one character if it occupies the full
	field size.
	(ReadDPXImage): Validate that the bits per sample claimed by the
	file header is a supported depth before using it further in the
	code.  This might resolve Coverity CID 10071 "Bad shift
	operation".
	(ReadDPXImage): Check for EOF while reading forward to element
	data.  Might solve Coverity CID 10305.

	* coders/dib.c (ReadDIBImage): Resolve Coverity CID 10228 "Integer

	"Missing unlock".

	* magick/colormap.c (ReplaceImageColormap): Allocate new image
	colormap up front in order to avoid the possibility that we are
	left with an image with no colormap due to memory allocation
	failure. If there is a memory allocation failure, then the
	original colormap is preserved.  Resolves Coverity CID 10194
	"Dereference after null check".

	* magick/utility.c (MagickStripSpacesFromString): New private
	utility function to strip spaces from a string.

	including unlocking the semaphore.  Resolves Coverity CID 10232.

	* coders/png.c (ReadOnePNGImage): Moved a logging statement into a
	block where "attribute" has been checked for NULL.  Resolves
	Coverity CIDs 10185 and 10187.

	* coders/png.c (ReadMNGImage): Fixed a cut-and-paste typo
	(change_delay should be change_timeout) reported by Coverity
	CID 10090.

2015-01-20  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (CloneImage): The definition is poor as to what a
	non-orphan clone should do.  However, the definition surely does
	not include crashing the software or supplanting the original
	image in an image list.  Clone image blob and previous/next
	pointers but do not supplant original image in list.  Resolves
	Coverity CID 10155.

2015-01-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/bit_stream.c (BitAndMasks): Avoid possible access
	one-beyond end of BitAndMasks array.  It is not clear if there is
	a possible bug with 32-bit quantums.  If there is a bug, it has
	not been noticed via testing.  Resolves Coverity CID 10213.

	* magick/tempfile.c (AcquireTemporaryFileDescriptor): Avoid buffer
	overrun in the case of an astonishingly long environment variable
	string.  Resolves Coverity CID 10267.
	(AddTemporaryFileToList): Use strlcpy() rather than strlcpy().  In
	practice, should not make a difference.  Will quiet Coverity CID
	10321.

	* magick/command.c (GMCommandSingle): Don't use the address of a
	stack allocation to update argv[0]. Removed updating argv[0] until
	a better design can be found.  Resolves Coverity CID 10223.
	(GMCommandSingle): Plan B: Use static allocation from
	SetClientName() to both store the new command name and provide
	storage for argv[0].

	* magick/utility.c (SystemCommand): Fix possible overwrite of
	memory location due to uninitialized 'end' pointer.  Resolves
	Coverity CID 10251.

	* magick/blob.c (WriteBlobFile): Was not closing file in certain
	error conditions.  Resolves Coverity CID 10237.

	* coders/cineon.c (ReadCINEONImage): Don't trust file header so
	much.  Resolves Coverity CIDs 10079, 10310, 10325.

	* coders/art.c (ReadARTImage): Fix signed vs unsigned comparison
	caused by earlier changes.

2015-01-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/resource.c (InitializeMagickResources): Base image width
	and height default limits on the range of a 32-bit signed integer,
	even for 64-bit builds.  These limits are still beyond what most

	pixels directly rather using SyncImage().  Problem was reported by
	Jodie Cunningham.

2015-01-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/pict.c (ReadPICTImage): Fix PICT reader crash when
	reading corrupted file.

	* coders/sun.c (ReadSUNImage): Sun reader was still not as robust
	as it should be.  Now it is.

2014-01-10 Fojtik Jaroslav  <JaFojtik@seznam.cz>

	* coders/wpg.c Fixed reading behind EOF issue.

2015-01-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/dpx.c (LSBPackedU32WordToOctets): Fix typo which adds
	severe corruption to encoded little-endian 32-bit packed output.
	The good news is that since the corruption is severe, it is easily
	visually detected.  The problem has corrupted all such
	(little-endian 10-bit) output since it was originally implemented
	on 2007-06-17 (changeset 11686, first released in GraphicsMagick
	1.1.8).  GraphicsMagick preserves the endianness of input DPX
	files by default, defaults to big-endian, and DPX files are
	commonly big-endian, so this problem may not have occured for many
	usages.  Problem was reported by Steve Dabner on the
	GraphicsMagick discussion mailing list.

2015-01-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/magick.c (MagickPanicSignalHandler): Print a message in

	is encountered while checking for "BA" header.

	* coders/icon.c (ReadIconImage): Limit icon image allocation size.

2015-01-04  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/icon.c (ReadIconImage): Removed all of the
	previously-existing DIB reading code from icon.c and use new
	"ICODIB" reader to read DIB icons, or the PNG reader to read PNG
	icons.

	* coders/dib.c (ReadDIBImage): Added an "ICODIB" coder for
	internal use which reads a Windows BMP 3 DIB followed by a Windows
	ICO alpha mask.  This allows existing DIB code to be used to read
	ICO directory entries.

2015-01-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/icon.c: The Windows ICO reader is now more robust.  Still
	a work in progress since some files still can not be read or read
	incorrectly.

2015-01-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/resource.c (ListMagickResourceInfo): "kilo" for binary
	prefixes is supposed to be "Ki".

	* magick/utility.c (FormatSize): "kilo" for binary prefixes is
	supposed to be "Ki".

2015-01-01  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c: Use WidthResource and HeightResource instead
	of fixed 1-million limit for rows and columns.

2015-01-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/utility.c (FormatSize): Add 'i' to value range
	identifiers since these are all in units of 2^10 rather than 1000.

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (CheckImagePixelLimits): Fix typo and
	produce an informative error message.

	* magick/resource.c: Added support for Image width and height
	pixels resource limits.

	* magick/resource.h (ResourceType): New resource enumerations
	WidthResource and HeightResource.

	* magick/enum_strings.c (StringToResourceType): Added support for
	parsing '-limit Width' and '-limit Height'.

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (CheckImagePixelLimits): New function to
	test image to see if it exceeds pixels limits.

	* coders/viff.c (ReadVIFFImage): Make the VIFF reader robust with
	detecting and reporting problems.
