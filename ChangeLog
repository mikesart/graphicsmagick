	* magick/version.h.in: Added MagickLibInterfaceNewest and
	MagickLibInterfaceOldest preprocessor defines so that applications
	may easily test for library versions while compiling.

2010-01-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/render.c (DrawPolygonPrimitive): Use restrict keyword.

	* magick/pixel_iterator.c: Use restrict keyword.

	* utilities/Makefile.am: Modules are supported in the shared
	library built so list-module.sh test should be expected to pass.

	* configure.ac: Add WITH_SHARED_LIBS conditional.

2010-01-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/version.h.in: Update copyright years.

	* magick/semaphore.c: The return code from all pthread mutex APIs
	are now checked (not just initialize and destroy), and any error
	results in an immediate fatal exit.
