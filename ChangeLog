	release.

2014-08-09  Jaroslav Fojtik  <JaFojtik@seznam.cz>

        * coders/webp.c webp cannot be compiled when HasWEBP is not set.

2014-08-08  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c: Eliminated palette and depth optimization (see
	https://sourceforge.net/p/graphicsmagick/feature-requests/35/).

2014-08-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* dcraw/dcraw.c: Fix dcraw build for x64 target when only WIN64 is
	defined (by also defining WIN32).

	* VisualMagick/configure/configure.cpp (write_file): Fix problem
	with x64 project naming which caused object file disambiguation
	not to work for x64 target. Make line terminations consistent.

2014-08-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* VisualMagick: VisualMagick fixes by Dirk Lemstra to improve
	configure program so that it is possible to select QuantumDepth,
	OpenMP, and 64-bit build via configure dialog boxes as well as
	options on the command line.  Also automatically detects and deals
	with similarly named files in subdirectories so that WebP support
	can now build successfully.  Resolves SF patches 31, 33, 35, 37,
	and 38.

2014-07-27  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/nt_base.c (NTResourceToBlob): Support loading mgk files
	as Windows resource from library if MagickLibName is defined.
	Patch contributed by Dirk Lemstra via SF patch #32.
	(NTGhostscriptDLL): For Microsoft Windows, add support for a
	MAGICK_GHOSTSCRIPT_PATH environment variable which specifies the
	path to Ghostscript.  If this environment variable is defined,
	then the Windows registry is not used to find Ghostscript.  Patch
	contributed by Dirk Lemstra via SF patch #39.

	* magick/log.c: Added SetLogMethod() to allow an
	application/library to specify a function to be called for
	logging.  Patch contributed by Dirk Lemstra.

2014-07-20  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/bmp.c: "opacity" read from a BMP3 is actually "alpha",
	so store q->opacity=MaxRGB-opacity instead of q->opacity=opacity.
	Reference: Bug tracker [bugs:#271] Blank result for BMP resize.

2014-07-20  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* webp, VisualMagick/webp: Integrate webp 0.4.0 into windows
	build.  May require manual renaming of output object files in
	project files to build webp until VisualMagick configure is
	improved!

2014-07-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/composite.c: fmin() and fmax() are defined by C'99 and
	not available everywhere, so add and use MagickFmin() and
	MagickFmax() to improve portability.

2014-07-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Magick++/lib/Magick++/Image.h (Magick): Fix complilation errors
	caused by continued raw use of __attribute__.

2014-06-30  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/composite.c: Fixes by Brendan Lane for color channel
	overflows in modified/new quantum operators.  Fixes test suite
	results for Q32 build and makes LinearBurn and LinearDodge work
	correctly at all.

	* wand/pixel_wand.c (PixelSetMagenta): Fix documentation.
	Resolves SourceForge bug #273 'Green Magenta' typo in docs.

2014-06-28  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/composite.c: Composition improvements and additions
	contributed by Brendan Lane via SourceForge patch #34 "Most of the
	missing Photoshop separable compositing operations"
	(https://sourceforge.net/p/graphicsmagick/patches/34/).  These
	composition operators were modified to include alpha in their
	computations: Difference, Darken, Lighten, HardLight, and these
	operators were added Overlay, Exclusion, ColorBurn, ColorDodge,
	SoftLight, LinearBurn, LinearDodge, LinearLight, VividLight,
	PinLight, HardMix.

2014-06-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/composite.c (ScreenCompositePixels): Implementation of
	Screen composite contributed by Brendan Lane.  SourceForge patch
	#30 "Missing Screen composite operation".

	* wand/magick_compat.c: Re-worked Wand library implementation to
	depend directly on GraphicsMagick library functionality rather
	than using ImageMagick shim code from magick_compat.c and
	magick_compat.h. The magick_compat.c source module becomes "dead
	code", which remains only to support the existing ABI, and will be
	deleted at the next major ABI break point.

	* magick/utility.c (MagickFormatString): New private function to
	format a string into a buffer with a specified size.  Same as
	previously existing FormatString() except requires a length
	argument.

2014-06-15  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* wand/magick_compat.h: Use MAGICK_ATTRIBUTE definition from
	magick/common.h.

	* magick/common.h (MAGICK_ATTRIBUTE): Don't undefine __attribute__
	since this may be used by system or compiler headers.  Define
	private macro instead.  Resolves SourceForge bug #270 "Compile
	error with g++ -std=c++11".

2014-06-06  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c (ReadOnePNGImage): Free png_pixels and
	quantum_scanline before error return.  Use "png_error()"
	instead of "ThrowException2()" for errors occuring while
	decoding a PNG so proper cleanup will happen.

2014-06-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (ReadTIFFImage): Make sure that libtiff warnings
	are promoted to errors for critical tags.

2014-06-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (ReadTIFFImage): Be quite a lot more draconian
	when retrieving the baseline standard TIFF tags we need in order
	to avoid consuming uninitalized data later.  An error with these
	tags will result in failure to read the image file.

2014-05-21  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/operator.c: Decided that ThresholdBlackNegateQuantumOp
	and ThresholdWhiteNegateQuantumOp should set the result to white
	or black respectively rather than being based on subtraction.

2014-05-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Be ultra-pedantic with CPPFLAGS
	and include paths in order to assure that only required
	directories are supplied, and to avoid accidential collision with
	system header files.

2014-05-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/operator.h ("C"): New quantum operators
	ThresholdBlackNegateQuantumOp and ThresholdWhiteNegateQuantumOp.
	These correspond to -operator "Threshold-Black-Negate" and
	"Threshold-White-Negate".

2014-05-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/composite.c (MultiplyCompositePixels): Multiply
	composition now uses SVG interpretation of how alpha should be
	handled.  No longer does a simple multiply of alpha channel.
	Behavior change.  Patch contributed by Sara Shafaei.

	* coders/msl.c (ProcessMSLScript): Deal with case where
	image_info->attributes is NULL.

2014-04-29  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/utility.c (TranslateTextEx): Support additional format
	specifiers 'g', 'A', 'C', 'D', 'G', 'H', 'M', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'T',
	'U', 'W', 'X', and '@'.
	(GetMagickGeometry): Support '>' and '<' qualifiers with '@'
	qualifier to specify if image should be resized if larger or
	lesser than given area specification.  Resolves SourceForge bug
	#216 ">" wont take effect when use @ to specify the maximum area.

	* magick/transform.c (GetImageMosaicDimensions): Move mosaic
	dimensions code to a static function for possible future re-use.

2014-04-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/gradient.c (GradientImage): Update image is_grayscale and
	is_monochrome flags based on gradient color properties.

2014-04-20  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/utility.c (GetMagickGeometry): Deal with resize geometry
	missing width or height (e.g. '640x' or 'x480') by substituting
	the missing value with one which preserves the image aspect ratio.
	This has been documented to be supported since almost the dawn of
	GraphicsMagick but was not actually supported until now.

2014-04-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* doc/options.imdoc: Document WebP encoder options.

	* coders/webp.c (WriteWEBPImage): Support all of the WebP encoder
	options via -define arguments.  Most of this work is contributed
	by Roman Hiestand.

	* configure.ac: User-provided LIBS should be prepended to LIBS
	that configure script produces so that user option takes
	precedence.

2014-04-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/Magick.xs: Added support for HardLight composition
	operator.

	* www/perl.rst: Update PerlMagick documentation, including the
	composition operators.

	* coders/xcf.c (GIMPBlendModeToCompositeOperator): Use new
	HardLight composition operator to support XCF GIMP_HARDLIGHT_MODE
	blend mode.  Contributed by Sara Shafaei.

	* coders/psd.c (CompositeOperatorToPSDBlendMode): Use new
	HardLight composition operator to support PSD "hLit" blend mode.
	Contributed by Sara Shafaei.

	* wand/magick_wand.c (MagickOperatorImageChannel): New function to
	apply an operator to an image channel.  Contributed by Sara
	Shafaei.

	* magick/composite.c (HardLightCompositePixels): New HardLight
	composition operator.  Contributed by Sara Shafaei.

2014-04-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (BenchmarkImageCommand): Add a CSV title line
	and quoting to benchmark -rawcsv output.

2014-04-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/webp.c: Add progress indication support to WebP writer.

	* magick/command.c (VersionCommand): WebP support is included in
	-version output.

	* coders/webp.c: WebP coder identifies library version and header
	ABI versions. Improve WebP error reporting.

2014-04-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (WriteTIFFImage): Allow specifying the TIFF image
	software tag.  In the special case that the string length is zero
	(e.g. -set software '') then the tag is skipped entirely.  This is
	to support SourceForge feature request #37 "Option to prevent
	addition of Exif Software tag" opened by Jean-Louis Grall.  Please
	note that this tag is not an EXIF tag.

	* magick/command.c: composite, convert, display, mogrify, and
	import now support +set to remove an existing image attribute.

2014-03-16  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c: Don't block threads when PNG_SETJMP_SUPPORTED is
	not enabled.

	* coders/png.c: Changed prefix of macros defined in coders/png.c
	from PNG_ to GMPNG_.  PNG_ is reserved for macros defined by
	libpng.

2014-03-16  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/blob.c: Don't use setvbuf() to set stdio block size if
	filesystem block size is zero (e.g. MAGICK_IOBUF_SIZE=0)

2014-03-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* tests/{rwblob.tap, rwfile.tap}: Added tests for WEBP.

	* tests/{rwblob.c, rwfile.c}: Add lossy hint for WEBP.

	* coders/webp.c (WriteWEBPImage): Fix inverted return status.
	Added a tiny bit of logging.

2014-03-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* ttf: Updated FreeType to release 2.5.3 of March 6, 2014.
	Provides security fixes for CVE-2014-2240.

	* jpeg: Update to libjpeg 9a of 19-Jan-2014.

	* png: Update to Libpng 1.6.10 - March 6, 2014.

2014-03-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/nt_base.c (NTResourceToBlob): According to Microsoft
	Report article 193678 (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/193678),
	FreeResource() is not needed in WIN32 and performs no useful
	function.  Remove use of it.  Also remove use of UnlockResource()
	which is similarly unuseful for WIN32.

	* configure.ac (MAGICK_LIBRARY_REVISION): Test for Windows
	_aligned_malloc() is not reliable.  Use Windows CRT version to
	decide if it is available.

2014-03-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/studio.h: Make sure that Windows _aligned_malloc() is not
	used under MinGW unless the CRT version allows it.

2014-02-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (InterpolateViewColor): Applied patch by
	Troy Patteson plus fixes to ignore opacity channel if image matte
	is false.  Replaces most of the code rewritten on 2014-02-16 and
	which produced a faint darkened border.  The results look stellar
	now.

2014-02-24  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/shear.c: Applied patch by Troy Patteson to improve
	non-integral rotation by around 40% by minimizing added image
	borders.  This may cause small differences in results for some
	images.

	* reference/filter/Rotate10.miff: Update rotate 10 degrees
	reference image so that PerlMagick test passes.

	* magick/shear.c: Applied patch by Troy Patteson to fix
	SourceForge issue #260 "Rotation exhibits clipping/shearing errors
	for short wide images at some angles".

2014-02-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* doc/options.imdoc: Fix documentation to note that 'unspecified
	alpha' is the GraphicsMagick default when writing TIFF rather than
	'associated alpha'.  Much thanks to Mats Peterson for alerting us
	of this error.

2014-02-16  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (InterpolateViewColor): Added a hack so that
	affine transformations and displace composite do not have
	background colored fringing on the transferred image edges when
	the background is completely transparent.  Fringing problem was
	caused by one or more of the line ends being a transparent pixel
	outside of the bounds of the original image content.  May not be
	the final solution.

2014-02-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/semaphore.c (AcquireSemaphoreInfo): Document that this
	function was deprecated.
	(LiberateSemaphoreInfo): Document that this function was
	deprecated.

2014-02-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/psd.c (RegisterPSDImage): Set PSD to UnstableCoderClass
	since its implementation is currently rather marginal.  It may
	even be that this coder deserves to be marked with the new
	BrokenCoderClass.  We are still looking for a volunteer to iron
	out the wrinkles in the PSD reader.

	* magick/magick.h (CoderClass): Added BrokenCoderClass to mark
	coders which often malfunction or are not very useful in their
	current condition.  Sometimes there is still hope that problems
	will be resolved and so the source file is not outright deleted.
	This setting allows us to mark and use coders which might
	malfunction by defining MAGICK_CODER_STABILITY=BROKEN in the
	environment while not causing danger for normal use.

2014-02-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* wand/magick_wand.c: Documentation improvements for
	MagickSetInterlaceScheme() and MagickSetImageInterlaceScheme().
	Resolves SourceForge bug #262 "setImageInterlaceScheme doesn't
	make image progressive".

2014-02-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/{ps.c, ps2.c, ps3.c, pdf.c}: Only use resolution from
	image or -density if units was properly specified.  Without units,
	resolution is worthless.

	* coders/ps3.c (WritePS3Image): Use image resolution similar to PDF
	changes.

	* coders/ps2.c (WritePS2Image): Use image resolution similar to PDF
	changes.

	* coders/ps.c (WritePSImage): Use image resolution similar to PDF
	changes.

	* coders/pdf.c (WritePDFImage): Use resolution from image if it
	appears to be valid.  Resolves SourceForge issue #261 "PNG Pixel
	Density Not Preserved Converting to PDF".

	* magick/enum_strings.c (StringToResolutionType): New function to
	convert ResolutionType to C string.
	(ResolutionTypeToString): New function to convert from C string to
	ResolutionType.

2014-02-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* wand/magick_wand.c (MagickGetImageGeometry): New function to get
	the image geometry string.  This function and the three others in
	this change set are contributed by Sara Shafaei.
	(MagickGetImageMatte): New function to read the image matte
	(opacity) channel enable flag.
	(MagickSetImageGeometry): New function to set the image geometry
	string.
	(MagickSetImageMatte): New function to set the image matte
	(opacity) channel enable flag.

2014-01-31  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* wand/magick_wand.c (MagickDrawImage): Remove development debug
	fprintf which causes each drawing primitive to be printed to
	stderr.

2014-01-21  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/pnm.c (ReadPNMImage): Fix scaling of alpha in sub-ranged
	pixels.  Addresses SourceForge issue #237 "Incorrect MAXVAL
	scaling when reading PAM images", which was not fully fixed in by
	the previous attempt.

2014-01-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/tsd.c: Implement TSD for "pure" OpenMP mode without
	relying on POSIX or WIN32 TSD APIs.

	* magick/semaphore.c: Implement OpenMP-based locking so that code
	can compile in a "pure" OpenMP mode without relying on POSIX or
	WIN32 locking APIs.

	* configure.ac: --without-threads no longer disables use of
	OpenMP.  Use the already existing option --disable-openmp to
	disable OpenMP.

2014-01-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/common.h: Support use of clang/llvm __attribute__ and
	__builtin extensions similar to the existing support for GCC.

2014-01-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Magick++/lib/Image.cpp (thumbnail): New method for fast image
	resizing, particularly to make thumbnails.

	* coders/gif.c: Log when Netscape loop exension is read and
	written.

	* coders/png.c (WriteOnePNGImage): In optimize mode, disable matte
	channel immediately if there are no non-opaque pixels.  Also added
	some useful logging.  Resolves SourceForge issue #252 "convert an
	8bit PNG result in a corrupted image ".

	* wand/magick_wand.c (MagickSetImageGravity): New Wand method to
	set image gravity.
	(MagickGetImageGravity): New wand method to get image gravity.

2014-01-02  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c (ReadOnePNGImage): Use libpng function
	png_set_strip_16_to_8() when scaling 16-bit input PNG down to
	8-bit in a Q8 build.  The png_set_scale_16_to_8() function is
	more accurate, but the slight difference causes reference tests
	to fail and causes unexpected difference between the behavior
	of PNG and other formats.  If png_set_strip_16_to_8() is not
	supported in libpng, then we use png_set_scale_16_to_8() if
	that is available.
