2010-03-08  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* version.sh: Released GraphicsMagick 1.3.12.

2010-03-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/Makefile.am: Update PerlMagick/Magick.pm in the
	source tree (as required) since it is distributed source and
	contains the current version number.

2010-03-03  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple...>

	* coders/png.c: restored missing "US" in PNG_USER_CHUNK_CACHE_MAX
        at line 102.  Added some (unsigned long) typecasts on print statements
        to stifle warnings.

2010-03-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* png: Updated libpng to 1.2.43.  Resolves CVE-2010-0205 as
	pertains to GraphicsMagick Windows build.

2010-03-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* tests/rwfile_DCX_*.sh: Add tests for reading and writing DCX.

	* coders/pcx.c (WritePCXImage): DCX is not the same as PCX so only
	write DCX when requested to (and vice-versa).

	* utilities/tests/convert-pipe-out.sh: New test to verify that
	'convert' can write to stdout.

	* utilities/tests/convert-pipe-in.sh: New test to verify that
	'convert' can read from stdin.

	* utilities/tests/convert-pipe-filter.sh: New test to verify that
	'convert' works properly as a filter.

	* magick/image.c (SetImageInfo): The 'rectify' parameter was found
	to not be sufficient to meet requirements since it was
	overloaded. The utilities would malfunction (hang or throw an
	exception) if requested to write to stdout.  As a result, this
	parameter has been changed to a binary flag type parameter.
	Existing True/False values are mapped to equivalents using the new
	binary flag.  This is intended to resolve Debian bug 571719
	"graphicsmagick: "convert" command is broken", reported by
	Vladimir Stavrinov.

2010-02-21  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* version.sh: Released GraphicsMagick 1.3.11.

2010-02-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/composite.c (GetCompositionPixelIteratorCallback):
	OverCompositeOp and AtopCompositeOp may be replaced with
	CopyCompositeOp in the case where neither image has a matte
	channel.

	* magick/command.c (ConvertImageCommand, MogrifyImageCommand):
	Added -extent option to apply a background color canvas behind the
	image. Added -compose option to allow specifying the composition
	operator to use.

	* magick/transform.c (ExtentImage): New function apply a
	background color canvas behind the image.

2010-02-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c: Added a -thumbnail command to all of the GM
	sub-commands which currently support -resize.  This is a resize
	method optimized for speed when reducing the size of the image
	(such as when creating thumbnails).

2010-02-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/utility.c (LocaleCompare, LocaleNCompare): Fix array
	index underflow which occurs if the char type is signed and the
	character value is in the extended range.  Problem reported by
	Arseny Solokha.  Resolves SourceForge patch #2953314.

2010-02-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* version.sh: Released GraphicsMagick 1.3.10.

2010-02-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Magick++/demo/demo.cpp (main): Split demo output frames into
	individual files to enable easier viewing.

2010-02-08  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* doc/GraphicsMagick.imdoc: Improve usage synopsis for
	'convert'. SourceForge feature request 2845965 "confusing
	documentation".

	* magick/display.c (MagickXDisplayImage): Image number was
	incorrect in window title.

	* magick/render.c (DrawImage): Path points data allocation was
	much larger than it needed to be.  Patch by Vladimir Lukianov.
	Resolves SourceForge issue 2947851 "Memory allocation error on
	vector graphics (or mem bomb)".

	* magick/constitute.c (WriteImages): +adjoin was not working
	correctly for the case when only one image frame is present.  With
	+adjoin and writing one frame to "foo%d.jpg" it was outputting
	"foo%d.jpg" rather than "foo0.jpg".  Problem reported by Frans
	Coetzee.

2010-02-04  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* version.sh: Released GraphicsMagick 1.3.9.

	* VisualMagick/bin/delegates.mgk: Sending output to "win:" now
	sends output to Windows Picture and Fax Viewer (shimgvw.dll)
	rather than gmdisplay.

2010-02-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* doc/imdoc2man: Bare single quotes at the beginning of a line
	need to be escaped in order to make roff happy.  Problem reported
	by Daniel Kobras.

	* magick/command.c (ImportImageCommand): Don't assign a pointer to
	static constant data into an array which uses heap allocated data.
	Avoids a "double free" error when using gm import -frame.  Patch
	by Daniel Kobras.

	* magick/color_lookup.c (QueryColorname): XPM does not support
	RGBA color syntax, but it does support RGB.  Patch by Daniel
	Kobras.

	* magick/blob.c (OpenBlob): Only form multi-part filename when
	required.

	* magick/display.c (MagickXDisplayImage): The display '-update'
	option was only working in conjunction with the '-delay' option
	with a delay setting of 2 or greater.  Problem reported by Sami
	Liedes.  Patch by Vincent MAUGE.  Resolves Debian bug ID 414779.

2010-02-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/blob.c (OpenBlob): Only apply scene substitution to
	the filename if adjoin is false.

	* magick/constitute.c (WriteImage): If adjoin is true, then
	restore original filename specification since opening the blob
	modifies it.  Resolves Debian bug ID 552998.

	* magick/image.c (SetImageInfo): Don't check filename for scene
	substitution if adjoin is intentionally false.  This allows saving
	to file names which look like they contain a scene substitution
	pattern.

	* magick/command.c (MogrifyImage): Convolution failure results in
	a crash rather than an error report.  Resolves Debian bug ID
	539251.

2010-02-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/deprecate.c: The string constants LoadImageText,
	SaveImageText, LoadImagesText, and SaveImagesText should have been
	deprecated, rather than being entirely removed.

2010-01-31  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* www/Makefile.am (install-data-html): Make sure that only the
	necessary documentation files are installed.

2010-01-28  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/transform.c (FlattenImages): Apply the image background
	color under the initial canvas image if it is non-opaque.

	* magick/composite.c (MagickCompositeImageUnderColor): New private
	function to apply a color underneath a non-opaque image.

2010-01-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/effect.c (BlurImageScanlines): Solid color images which
	only differed in the matte channel were not being blurred.

	* magick/color.h (NotPixelMatch,PixelMatch): New macros to
	fully-compare a pixel, including matte.

2010-01-25  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/resource.c (SetMagickResourceLimit): Invoke
	omp_set_num_threads() to set thread limit if ThreadsResource is
	requested.

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (AllocateThreadViewSet): The number of
	cache views to allocate needs to be obtained from
	omp_get_max_threads().  Otherwise there is a crash if the number
	of threads is reduced from the original value.

2010-01-21  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* version.sh: Released GraphicsMagick 1.3.8.
	
	* NEWS.txt: Update for the 1.3.8 release.

2010-01-20  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* www/benchmarks.rst: Update benchmark report to compare
	performance with ImageMagick 6.5.8-10.

2010-01-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/shear.c (RotateImage, ShearImage): Ensure that errors
	propagate up to the API user.  Don't overwrite a detailed
	exception message with a generic one.  Don't return a bogus image
	if there is an error.

2010-01-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* VisualMagick/installer/inc/files-base.isx: Third party
	executables not included in the Visual Studio build are no longer
	bundled in the GraphicsMagick installer.  This means that
	hp2xx.exe, mpeg2dec.exe, and mpeg2enc.exe are no longer
	distributed.

	* www/Magick++/Image.rst: Emphasize that InitializeMagick() MUST
	be invoked, and make sure that all of the examples show use of it.

2010-01-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/delegate.c (InvokeDelegate): Use MagickSpawnVP() under
	Windows as well.
	(InvokePostscriptDelegate): Use MagickSpawnVP() under Windows as
	well.

	* magick/utility.c (MagickSpawnVP): Moved from unix_port.c.
	Updated implementation to use spawnvp() rather than fork()/exec()
	under Windows.

	* configure.ac: Add check for Windows spawnvp function.
	Add check for process.h.

	* magick/semaphore.c (DestroySemaphore): POSIX mutex statically
	initialized via PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER should not be destroyed.

	* configure.ac: DisableSlowOpenMP is now the default.  Use
	--enable-openmp-slow to enable OpenMP for algorithms which
	sometimes run slower rather than faster.

2010-01-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/version.h.in: Added MagickLibInterfaceNewest and
	MagickLibInterfaceOldest preprocessor defines so that applications
	may easily test for library versions while compiling.

2010-01-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/render.c (DrawPolygonPrimitive): Use restrict keyword.

	* magick/pixel_iterator.c: Use restrict keyword.

	* utilities/Makefile.am: Modules are supported in the shared
	library built so list-module.sh test should be expected to pass.

	* configure.ac: Add WITH_SHARED_LIBS conditional.

2010-01-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/version.h.in: Update copyright years.

	* magick/semaphore.c: The return code from all pthread mutex APIs
	are now checked (not just initialize and destroy), and any error
	results in an immediate fatal exit.
