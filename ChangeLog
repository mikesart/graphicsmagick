2003-09-24  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (WriteTIFFImage): Add support for writing
	colormapped TIFF images with 1, 2, & 4 bits per colormap index.
	This allows writing smaller files.

2003-09-24  Lars Ruben Skyum  <lars.skyum@stibo.com>

	* coders/ps3.c: Now creates a correct %%BoundingBox for images
	with resolution stored as pixels per centimeter. Renamed serialize
	functions. Added comment headers where they were
	missing. Reformatted code to be in alignment with GraphicsMagick
	standard formatting.
	* magick/map.c: Fixed semaphore double locking problem in
	MagickMapCloneMap.

2003-09-23  Mike Chiarappa  <mikechiarappa@libero.it>

	* BCBMagick/readme.txt : Updated compilation instructions.
	* BCBMagick/magick/libMagick.bpr : Updated project, now include map.c.
	* BCBMagick/lcms/Projects/BCB6/lcms.bpr : Updated project, now include 
	  cmscam02.c and cmsvirt.c.
	Much thanks to Alex Dvoretsky for bringing this problem to my attention.
	
2003-09-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.h (Image): Moved private members to bottom of
	structure.
	(_ImageInfo): Moved private members to bottom of
	structure.
	* magick/Makefile.am (pkginclude_HEADERS): Don't install
	semaphore.h.
	(noinst_HEADERS): Distribute map.h and semaphore.h.
	* magick/image.h (ImageInfo): Change coder_options member from
	type 'MagickMap' to type 'void *'.
	* coders/png.c: include magick/semaphore.h.

	* magick/log.c: include magick/semaphore.h.
	* magick/magic.c: include magick/semaphore.h.
	* magick/magick.c: include magick/semaphore.h.
	* magick/module.c: include magick/semaphore.h.
	* magick/semaphore.c: include magick/semaphore.h.
	* magick/stream.c: include magick/semaphore.h.
	* magick/tempfile.c: include magick/semaphore.h.
	* magick/type.c: include magick/semaphore.h.
	* magick/blob.h (_BlobInfo): Changed 'Semaphore *' to 'void *'.
	* magick/cache.h (_CacheInfo): Changed 'Semaphore *' to 'void *'.
	* magick/image.h (_Image): Changed 'Semaphore *' to 'void *'.
	* magick/command.c: Updated each invokation of MagickMapAddEntry()
	to add an exception argument.
	* tests/maptest.c: Updated to pass an exception argument to
	MagickMapAddEntry.
	* magick/image.c (AddCoderOptions): Added exception argument
	and some more error handling.
	* magick/map.c: Added formal documentation for methods.
	(MagickMapCloneMap): Added exception argument.
	(MagickMapAddEntry): Added exception argument and status.

2003-09-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/emf.c: Changed NotAnEMFFile to ImproperImageHeader.
	* magick/map.h: Changed all size parmeters from type 'unsigned
	long' to 'size_t'.
	* magick/map.c (MagickMapCopyBlob): Add new function to support
	copying a Blob in a MagickMap.
	(MagickMapDeallocateBlob): Add new function to support
	deallocating a Blob in MagickMap.

2003-09-23  Lars Ruben Skyum  <lars.skyum@stibo.com>

	* coders/ps3.c: Fixed handling the case when no -coder-options are
	provided to the PS3 coder.

2003-09-22  Lars Ruben Skyum  <lars.skyum@stibo.com>

	* coders/ps3.c: Changed %%Creator version to use
	MagickLibVersionText, increased precision in HiResBoundingBox,
	added a coder specific option for rendering bilevel images with
	the PS imagemask operator indstead of the image operator.  
	* magick/command.c: Added "-coder-options" command line argument
	to all relevant command line utilities. Option argument to
	-coder-options is a list of comma separated key-value pairs that
	are saved in a MagickMap in ImageInfo for (de-)coders to use. See
	PS3 coder for an example that checks for: -coder-options
	"ps:image=imagemask"
	* magick/image.c, magick/image.h: Added function AddCoderOptions().
	* magick/map.c, magick/map.h: removed MS-DOS line terminators.

2003-09-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* tests/maptest.c (main): Test/demo program for key,value map API.
	* magick/map.c, magick/map.h: Implementation of a key,value map
	API for internal use.

2003-09-19  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>
	* lcms/include/icc34.h lcms.h: Added back the icc34.h header and
	changes to make lcms compile on Win32" icc34.h lcms.h.

2003-09-19  Lars Ruben Skyum  <lars.skyum@stibo.com>

	* coders/ps3.c: Fixed warnings from Solaris compiler.

2003-09-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* locale/C.mgk: Eliminated the many "NotA" messages since they may
	all be considered forms of "ImproperImageHeader".  It is useful to
	provide the origin of such messages in case the wrong coder has
	been invoked, however, this is expensive to do via the message
	database since it explodes the number of messages.  The exception
	logging can help here.  Once the exception reports include the
	reporting entity, it will be more clear when the software
	misbehaves.
	* magick/error.h (ThrowReaderException2): Remove since no longer
	used.
	(ThrowReaderException): Simplified implementation so that
	ThrowException is not expanded twice.
	* magick/error.h (ThrowReaderException3): Remove since never used.
	* coders/xtrn.c (ReadXTRNImage): Use ThrowReaderException rather
	than ThrowReaderException2.
	* locale/C.mgk (MissingArgument) Updated to include %s so that the
	description field appears earlier in the message.
	* magick/error.c (DefaultErrorHandler): Added a hack to allow the
	'reason' member to include a %s so that it may specify the
	formating of the message.  Care should be taken to not over-use
	this hack.

2003-09-18  Lars Ruben Skyum  <lars.skyum@stibo.com>

	* coders/ps3.c: Major update of the PS3 coder. Now ascii85 encodes
	all binary data. Many printer spoolers don't like the binary
	data. The coder now creates much smaller files for bilevel, gray,
	and colormapped images. Compression and image type is now
	separated so they may be combined independently. Any alpha channel
	is separated into a separate mask so it's possible to mask
	bilevel, gray, colormapped, rgb, and CKYK images. You may also
	mask a JPEG compressed PS file for instance. Clipping masks
	created from a photoshop clipping path with -clip option is
	converted to a corresponding postscript clipping path.  New
	functions need comment headers.
	* magick/attribute.c: Added TracePSClippingPath for creating a
	postscript clipping path from a photoshop clipping path.
	* magick/compress.c, magick/compress.h: Added write-hook based
	interface to compression functions. Required for ascii encoding
	compressed, binary data. The interface between blob write
	functions, compression functions, and encoding functions could
	benefit from more of this work.
	* magick/image.c: ClipPathImage now stores the name of the
	clipping path in the mask image filename so that it is remembered
	and may be used for creating a postscript clipping path for
	postscript output.
	* coders/modules.mgk: Added EPS3 mapping to module PS3.

2003-09-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c: Coalesced various "Missing" error reports into
	one "MissingArgument" error report in order to reduce the number
	of messages to be maintained.
	* locale/C.mgk: Removed almost all "Missing" messages.
	* magick/gm_messages.mc: Added Microsoft message compiler source
	file to CVS until which time it may be generated automatically
	during the build.

2003-09-16  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* locale/Makefile: Added ability to generate gm_messages.mc
	(for Windows message compiler) as well as adding 'clean' and
	'install' targets.
	* magick/delegate.h: Visual Studio .NET 2003 doesn't like
	the chaining of GhostscriptVector members which share a
	common return type. Splitting the definitions solves this
	problem.

2003-09-15  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/deprecate.h (MagickSignedType): Compatibility definition
	to handle ImageMagick API change.
	(MagickUnsignedType): Compatibility definition to handle
	ImageMagick API change. The new names are just as useless as the
	old names, but at least they are shorter.
	* magick/command.c: Linux's sscanf has the terrible bug that it
	improperly handles pulling out the first floating value from the
	string "0x1".  Instead of retreiving the value 0 and returning 1,
	it returns 0, probably because it rejects the string as a hex
	constant. As a result, all options which used sscanf to validate
	this input are now converted to use IsGeometry().

2003-09-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* ltdl/ltdl.c: Update to libltdl current as of today.
	* ltmain.sh: Update to libtool current as of today.
	* configure.ac: For HPUX C++ compiler, add -AA to CXXFLAGS rather
	than CXX.

2003-09-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Decided that the standards conformance
	defines create more problems than they solve so they are
	removed.
	Move the large-file tests to before the libtool configuration
	since the libtool configuration was causing stdlib.h to be
	included prior to the large file defines, and this causes
	header failure with C++ under AIX.
	* www/api/types.html: Update description of MonitorHandler.

2003-09-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Set CXX to PTHREAD_CXX if necessary (and warn).
	* acinclude.m4 (ACX_PTHREAD): Add check to see if xlC_r should be
	used for AIX.

2003-09-10  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* magick/render.c: Fixed handling of arc primitive (see IM-5.5.8).

2003-09-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/log.h: It seems that test programs are using
	GetMagickModule so make it visible by default.
	* configure.ac: Use GM_FUNC_MMAP_FILEIO macro to test mmap.
	* acinclude.m4 (GM_FUNC_MMAP_FILEIO): New macro to test mmap's
	capability to do coherent file I/O.  The AC_FUNC_MMAP macro
	was not testing the mmap features that GraphicsMagick uses, and
	was failing on a number of systems.
	* magick/blob.c (BlobMapModeToString): Only include this static
	function if HAVE_MMAP is defined.
	* coders/locale.c (WriteLOCALEImage): Fix FormatString argument
	type inconsistencies.
	* wand/magick_compat.h: Change MagickExport to WandExport.
	* coders/jpeg.c, coders/locale.c, coders/meta.c, coders/miff.c,
	coders/palm.c, coders/pict.c, coders/svg.c, coders/tiff.c,
	coders/topol.c, magick/cache.c, magick/display.c, magick/image.c,
	magick/widget.c: Removed unused values, changed storage types, or
	added explicit casts, in order to reduce the number of "REMARK"s
	when using the SGI IRIX compiler.
	* magick/render.c (DrawClipPath): Fix memory leak of
	clone_info->clip_path.  Problem reported by Vladimir
	<lvm@integrum.ru>.
	(DestroyDrawInfo): Remove unnecessary checks for non-null prior to
	invoking MagickFreeMemory. MagickFreeMemory already checks for
	non-null.
	* magick/log.h (GetCurrentFunction): Apparently Visual C++ 6.0
	does not support __FUNCTION__.  Problem reported by Vladimir
	<lvm@integrum.ru>.
	* wand/magick_compat.c: All functions in magick_compat.c must use
	WandExport rather than MagickExport. Fix recommended by Vladimir
	<lvm@integrum.ru>.
	* magick/constitute.c (PushImagePixels): number_pixels was always
	cast to a long during use, so change to store value in a long
	instead.
	(PopImagePixels): number_pixels was always
	cast to a long during use, so change to store value in a long
	instead.

2003-09-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/psd.c: Eliminated warning regarding unused initialized
	variable.
	* magick/log.c: Eliminate type warnings regarding enum assignment.
	* coders/locale.c (WriteLOCALEImage): Use UndefinedException
	rather than 0 in severity_list terminating entry in order to avoid
	a type conversion warning.
	* magick/image.c (SetImageChannelDepth): Depth parameter was being
	returned rather than status.  Oops!
	* magick/effect.c (BlurScanline): Due to automatic casting
	conventions, computation was being done (at least with SGI
	compiler) as type 'unsigned long' rather than 'long' as it should
	have been.
	* coders/jpeg.c, coders/meta.c, coders/miff.c, coders/msl.c,
	coders/palm.c, coders/pcd.c, coders/psd.c, coders/svg.c,
	coders/tiff.c, coders/xcf.c, magick/render.c, : Quench many SGI
	compiler warnings regarding variables which are initialized but
	never used.
	* magick/xwindow.h: Undef gravity defines so that enumerated type
	is used instead.

2003-09-08  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/log.c (LogMagickEvent): Windows system logging
	functionality is not currently ported to work with Cygwin so
	disable when compiling under Cygwin.
	* magick/log.c (Win32EventlogOutput): Remove spurious comma in enum.
	* wand/drawing_wand.h: Remove junk comment marker that I forgot to
	remove.
	* magick/studio.h: Provide prototypes for strlcpy and vsnprintf if
	the system doesn't provide them in the requested compilation
	environment.
	* configure.ac: Add necessary standards compilance definitions to
	magick_config.h.
	Check for strlcpy and vsnprintf prototypes.
	* Makefile.am (DOCDIRS): www/api/types does not exist anymore.

2003-09-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Move multithread tests prior to libtool
	configuration in case value of CC is changed.  Otherwise libtool
	gets confused and refuses to run.
	* acinclude.m4 (ACX_PTHREAD): If using AIX CC 'xlc' use 'xlc_r'
	for multithread compiler.
	* coders/jpeg.c: Undef HAVE_STDLIB_H before including the
	jpeg headers or else we get an already defined error/warning.

2003-09-04  Mike Chiarappa  <mikechiarappa@libero.it>

	* BCBMagick : Updated whole directory tree to achieve correct
	compilation with Borland C++ Buider 6.0.

2003-09-04  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (ClipPathImage): Remove MS-DOS line terminations
	(actually, extra carriage returns) which somehow crept into
	ClipPathImage.
	* locale/C.mgk: Added message for "PNG library is too old".

2003-09-04  Lars Ruben Skyum  <lars.skyum@stibo.com>

	* magick/transform.c (ProfileImage): Bugfix: conditional
	compilation based on LCMS being present or not now works as
	expected. An exception is thrown if LCMS is not present and
	profile conversion is used.

2003-09-04  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/txt.c (ReadTXTImage): Fix strlen() pointer type warning.
	* magick/image.c (TextureImage): Fixed return with no value warning.
	* magick/color.c (GetColorInfoArray): Decided that the const
	return value was a bad idea.  Therefore, the return type has been
	made non-const.
	* magick/magick.c (GetMagickInfoArray): Decided that the const
	return value was a bad idea.  Therefore, the return type has been
	made non-const.	
	* tests/constitute.c, tests/rwblob.c, tests/rwfile.c : Define
	MAGICK_IMPLEMENTATION since these test programs using some internal
	extensions.
	* configure.ac: Test C++ compiler for __func__ support.
	* magick/log.h: Added GetCurrentFunction() macro to handle
	__func__ support determination.  Re-wrote GetMagickModule() macro
	to use GetCurrentFunction().  Changes should allow compilation of
	Magick++ when the C compiler supports __func__ but the C++
	compiler does not.
	* configure.ac: Changed from using HAS___func__ define to
	HAS_C__func__ since this feature may be language sensitive.
	* locale/C.mgk: Added missing JNGCompressionNotSupported message.

2003-09-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/attribute.c (Generate8BIMAttribute): Fix sscanf argument
	type mis-match.
	* coders/ps3.c (ZLIBEncodeImage): Fix mis-classified
	ZipLibraryIsNotAvailable error report.
	* coders/url.c (RegisterURLImage): Only register URL format
	support if libxml2 is available.
	* coders/msl.c (RegisterMSLImage): Only register MSL format
	support if libxml2 is available.

2003-09-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/histogram.c (WriteHISTOGRAMImage): Remove a useless loop.
	* coders/wpg.c: Applied patch from Fojtik Jaroslav to support
	reading WPGs which use the EXT token.

2003-08-31  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/color.c (HistogramToFile): Renamed static method
	'Histogram' to 'HistogramToFile' to make it more clear what this
	function does.
	(GetColorHistogram): Added new function to support retrieving a
	color histogram of the image.  A color histogram contains a count
	of how many times each color occurs in the image.
	* magick/image.c (GetImageChannelDepth): Return an 'unsigned int'
	rather than 'long'.

2003-08-29  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/Magick.xs: Add support for CopyCyan, CopyMagenta,
	CopyYellow, and CopyBlack, composition operators.
	* magick/composite.c (CompositeImage): Added support for
	CopyCyanCompositeOp, CopyMagentaCompositeOp,
	CopyYellowCompositeOp, and CopyBlackCompositeOp, composition
	operators.

2003-08-28  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* wand/*: Updated to current ImageMagick Wand API (minus a few
	unimplemented functions).
	* magick/image.c (TextureImage): Add status return because Wand API
	wants it.  Inherit is_grayscale status from texture image.
	* magick/fx.c (SolarizeImage): Add status return because Wand API
	wants it.
	* magick/resource.c (SetMagickResourceLimit): Add status return
	because Wand API wants it.
	* magick/draw.c (DrawPeekGraphicContext): Now returns a
	copy of the current DrawInfo context rather than returning
	a pointer into the context stack. The user must destroy
	this copy using DestroyDrawInfo() once it is no longer
	needed.

2003-08-25  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* VisualMagick/filters/LIBRARY.txt: This file is necessary to
	incorporate analyze.c into the static build.  Without it the
	build fails.

2003-08-23  Lars Ruben Skyum  <lars.skyum@stibo.com>

	* magick/transform.c: ProfileImage updated to handle alpha
	channels and grayscale images. Also optimized color profiling of
	color mapped images and fixed a few bugs in profiling of CMYK
	images.
	* magic/locale_c.h: added MagickExport to prototype declaration of
	GetLocaleMessageFromID in WriteLOCALEImage again. Please update
	your locale coder.
	
2003-08-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/wpg.c: Applied patch from Fojtik Jaroslav to use the
	GetMagicInfo() function to obtain the format of embedded images,
	and to provide a default WPG palette if the WPG file does not
	supply a palette.

2003-08-22  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>
	* magick\gm_messages.bin locale_c.h transform.c: Fixed missing
	message problem and added support for new lcms error handler.

2003-08-21  Lars Ruben Skyum  <lars.skyum@stibo.com>

	* magick/attribute.c, magick/image.c, magick/command.c: Added
	"clippath" option for clipping named Photoshop clipping paths,
	increased precision in clipping path knots, added comments, and
	fixed a few bugs resulting from moving TraceClippingPath function
	from ImageMagick to GraphicsMagick. Still need to update some of
	the documentation.
	* magick/locale_c.h, magick/studio.h: added MagickExport to
	declaration of GetLocaleMessageFromID and moved include of
	magick/locale_c.h after declaration of MagickExport. This fixes a
	link error in dynamic, DLL version.
	* coders/locale.h: added MagickExport to prototype declaration of
	GetLocaleMessageFromID in WriteLOCALEImage.

2003-08-21  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/t/subroutines.pl (testRead): Ignore useless TIFF
	warning so that 12-bit TIFF test passes.
	* magick/constitute.c (ReadImage): Ensure that the reported image
	magic string is that of the user-specified input file rather than
	a temporary file prepared by an external delegate program.
	* magick/command.c (ImportImageCommand): Since
	DestroyExceptionInfo() now sets the destroyed exception signature
	to an invalid value, GetExceptionInfo(exception) must be invoked
	when the intention is to simply purge the exception.  This fix
	resolves an abort when executing 'gm import'.

2003-08-18  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>
	* magick\gm_messages.bin locale_c.h transform.c: Updates that
	add latest enhancments by Lars to color management code in
	ProfileImage.

2003-08-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* coders/wpg.c: Incorporated patch from Fojtik Jaroslav to support
	rendering embedded WMFs.

2003-08-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/image.c (SetImageChannelDepth): New function to transform
	the specified channel so it fits the specified modulus depth.
	* magick/blob.c (BlobToImage): Skip calling SetImageInfo() if
	magick is already set.

2003-08-18  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>
	* PerlMagick/Magick.xs: Some fixes to get PerlMagick compiling
	again due to new ID based error macros.

2003-08-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/error.h (enum): Remove spurious comma.

2003-08-17  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>
	* coders\png.c: Had to modify a few excetpion calls to work with
	newest macros.

2003-08-17  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>
	* coders\locale.c magick/error.h locale.c locale_c.h studio.h:
	The LOCALEH header file generator now adds an MGK_ prefiix to
	all the ID defines as part of a fix to support the new error
	and exception macros cross platform.

2003-08-16  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>
	* wand\magick_wand.c pixel_wand.c: The wand api code was totally
	left out of the large macro conversion below as an oversight.

	xwindow.c : Changes to support ID based message access and checking
	all message usages. The main thing that was done was to remove all
	the quotes around the "tags" used to lookup messages defined in
	the locale\C.XML file. Macros were added to error.h to allow the
	code to be compiled for either string based access or binary ID
	based access. Using binary ID's will cause the code to fail to
	compile if a message does not exist in C.XML, since no ID will be
	created for a missing message. This change then allowed us to
	easily track down all the messages that were "missing" or not
	being accessed properly. The problems were massive and took many
	days to resolve. I have left the code compiling in ID mode to keep
	things in sync going forward and also because it makes message
	lookup instantaneous. An ID is just an index into and array of
	char *'s. There is still a lot of cleanup work remaining, but this
	is a very good start. 

2003-08-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/error.c (GetLocaleExceptionMessage): Add check to avoid
	duplicating severity prefix.
	* magick/log.c (LogMagickEvent): Incorporated fix from Bill
	Radcliffe to enable logging control flags to work properly again.
	* NEWS: Updated news.
	* magick/blob.c (OpenBlob): Rewind file descriptor so that first
	read is at zero offset. This fixes reading GIFs via a
	user-provided file handle.

2003-08-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (GetImageDepth): Extend so that the actual
	minimum depth required to represent the image is
	returned. Previously only the values 8, 16, and 32 were
	returned. This means that a value of one is returned for a
	monochrome image. Also fixed a bug in that the pixels were
	incremented while the depth was incremented, resulting in the
	first image pixels not being properly evaluated for depth.
	(SetImageDepth): Extend to support converting the image to
	arbitrary modulus depths.
	(GetImageChannelDepth): New function to obtain the modulus depth
	for a specified image channel.

2003-08-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/draw.c (MvgAutoWrapPrintf): StreamError reported when
	DrawError was intended.
	* coders/logo.c (ReadLOGOImage): Report FileOpenError rather than
	BlobError if requested image does not exist.

2003-08-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/cache.c (PersistCache): If HAVE_SYSCONF and _SC_PAGE_SIZE
	are defined, then assume that sysconf works and don't use legacy
	getpagesize() function.
	* magick/studio.h (_XOPEN_SOURCE): Should be defined as 600 in
	order to match _POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112L according to the Single
	UNIX Specification v3.  This is necessary for the vsnprintf
	prototype to be visible.
	* magick/attribute.c (ReadByte): Fix compilation warnings due to
	casting 'unsigned char *' to 'char *' by changing function
	definition to accept 'unsigned char *' instead.
	* magick/error.h (UndefinedException): UndefinedException should
	be ExceptionType, not ExceptionBaseType.
	* magick/magick.c (IsValidFilesystemPath): Eliminate warning about
	unused function when UseInstalledMagick is defined.
	* magick/error.c (ThrowLoggedException): Fix improper parameters
	passed to LogMagickEvent() when reason is not available.

003-08-07  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>

	* magick/log.c, log.h: Added ability to log by either severity
	or by category of event. Made the defualt on windows to log all
	fatal errors, errors, and warnings to the event log. This will
	include anything generated by exceptions currently, but not any
	normal "informational" logging.

2003-08-07  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>

	* magick/log.c, log.h: Translation of event codes to mask vals
	was not working. Code was left out of last update. It is now in.

2003-08-07  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>

	* magick/error.c: Protect against NULL string passed into the
	message lookup function.

2003-08-07  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>

	* magick/locale.c: Switched use of IsAccessible to nonloggging
	version to prevent recursive problems.

2003-08-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): Distribute locale_c.h.
	* locale/Makefile: Output locale_c.h.
	* utilities/gm.c (main): Fix typo in Unix InitializeMagick
	invocation.
	* configure.ac: Use ACX_PTHREAD pthreads test macro.
	* magick/(semaphore.c,spinlock.h,studio.h): Change HasPTHREADS
	conditional define to HAVE_PTHREAD.
	* magick/Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): Include spinlock.h in
	distribution.

2003-08-06  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>

	*  contrib\win32\ATL7\ImageMagickObject/ImageMagickObject.cpp, 
	ImageMagickObject_.h, ImageMagickObject.def, ImageMagickObject.rc
	gm.rc: Changes to get things compiling again since all windows
	specific logging support has been eliminated. The special build
	script BuildImageMagickObject.cmd now compiles the message file
	for resource based messages. The result is in gm_messages.bin.
	The script also generates a special version of gm.exe that uses
	the COM dll as a regular DLL and links to it. This is the long
	desired Moby DLL build idea.
	* magick/error.c, magick/error.h, magick/log.c, magick/log.h:
	Upgrade of logging system to take over previous special logging
	code for windows in nt_base.c. The new logic provides logging
	of events to the debug api and the windows event log and also
	provides a generic text file logging method.
	* magick/gm_messages.bin, magick/ImageMagick.rc: New compiled
	message file based on data in locale\C.mgk. RC file modified
	to include this as a resource.
	*  magick/locale.c, magick/locale_c.h: locale_c.h is generated by
	the LOCALEH format of the locale coder. The logic in locale.c
	uses the tables in the header lookup messages. On windows, all
	the messages are stored as resources, while on UNIX they remain
	in a string table.
	* locale/C.mgk: Removed duplicate messages and added some new
	default messages that help to create a complete set of severity
	strings.
	* magick/command.c, magick/magick.c: Get rid compiler warnings.

2003-08-05  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>

	* magick/command.c, magick/gm.c: Application level changes to
	implement the client name - filename changes. The client name
	can now be anything that the application wants and has nothing
	to do with the saved filename of the application.
	* magick/nt_base.c, magick/nt_base.h, magick/magick.c: Ripped
	out old nt specific debugging and logging logic. Moving to the
	standard logging. New and major revisions to InitializeMagick
	to make the code more maintainable, reliable, and reaable. It
	should be functionally identical, but implements the new split
	client name and filename methododology.
	* magick/utility.c, magick/utility.h: Added a couple of new
	routines to support splitting the overloaded use of the client
	name and client filename.
	* coders/xtrn.c: Minor code cleanup

2003-08-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Copyright.txt: Added missing copyright notice which is required
	due to copying the rlecomp manual page into ImageMagick.
	* doc/config_files.imdoc: Started documentation for configuration
	files.
	* magick/xwindow.c (XSignalHandler): Ensure that segment_info is
	non-null before attempting to use it.  Much thanks to John Cristy
	for bringing this problem to our attention.

2003-08-05  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>

	* coders/locale.c: Added several new formats to this coder to
	generate windows message resource format messages and also to
	generates a new header file format that will support a table based
	version of the other magick/locale.c.
	* coders/xtrn.c: Minor code cleanup

2003-08-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Only configure C and C++ libtool tags.
	* PerlMagick/t/reference/composite/*.miff: Added some composition
	test reference images.  These reference images will serve as
	placeholders until better composition tests can be figured out.
	It is not clear from the documentation what some of the
	composition operators are supposed to do.

2003-08-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* README.txt: Add documentation regarding using TRIO.
	* configure.ac: Test for TRIO library if vsnprintf is not
	available.
	* magick/studio.h: Remap vsnprintf to trio_vsnprintf if TRIO is
	available.
	* coders/topol.c, coders/wmf.c, magick/magick.c, magick/nt_base.c,
	magick/resource.c: Use traditional C comment form in C source
	files.

2003-07-31  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/log.h (LogEventType::AllEvents): Increase the value of
	AllEvents so that it spans the complete positive range of a signed
	integer.
	* magick/xwindow.c, magick/xwindow.h: Incorporate patch from John
	Cristy's ImageMagick to eliminate conditional dependence of
	magick/xwindow.h on <X11/extensions/XShm.h>.
	* magick/magick_config_api.h.in: HasSharedMemory define no longer
	needed.

2003-07-30  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* www/programming.html: Update Rmagick URL.
	* GraphicsMagick.spec.in : Update according to instructions from
	Troy Edwards.

2003-07-29  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* GraphicsMagick.spec.in: Replaced GraphicsMagick.spec with
	GraphicsMagick.spec.in, which is configured to produce
	GraphicsMagick.spec.
	* configure.ac: Configure GraphicsMagick.spec.

2003-07-29  Troy Edwards  <vallimar@sexorcisto.net>

	* GraphicsMagick.spec: Updated to CVS build. Added the
	GraphicsMagickWand files to the spec.  Only try to remove the
	unneeded perl package files if we are using PerlMagick.

2003-07-28  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* GraphicsMagick.spec: Added RPM spec file authored by Troy
	Edwards <vallimar@sexorcisto.net>.
	* NEWS: Add note regarding EXIF fix.
	* magick/attribute.c (GenerateEXIFAttribute): Look for the profile
	name "EXIF" rather than "APP1".

2003-07-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/magick_config_api.h.in: XWindowInfo structure in
	xwindow.h needs HasSharedMemory define.

	* magick/log.c (GetLogBlob): MAGICK_HOME needs to take
	precedence over the client path for the uninstalled build.
	* magick/type.c (GetTypeBlob): MAGICK_HOME needs to take
	precedence over the client path for the uninstalled build.
	* magick/blob.c (GetConfigureBlob): MAGICK_HOME needs to take
	precedence over the client path for the uninstalled build.
	* magick/module.c (FindMagickModule): MAGICK_HOME needs to take
	precedence over the client path for the uninstalled build.

2003-07-08  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>

	* magick/semaphore.c: Modified the way the system handles the
	initialization of Win32 critical sections to use a spin lock
	on WIn32 to bootstrap the initialization of all other crtical
	sections. This is not an issue on UNIX since static init is used.
	* magick/magic.c module.c magick.c log.c resource.c constitute.c
	color.c cache.c delegate.c registry.c type.c: Small modifications
	were made to eliminate the side effect of unlocking semaphores
	as part of the releasing procedure. This also eliminated the
	apparent bug of the system double locking certain semaphores.
	The locked flag should now not be needed, but remains in place
	for the time being as an added safegaurd.

2003-07-04  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* coders/Makefile.am: Build topol.c.
	* coders/topol.c: Added initial TOPOL X image coder which is under
	development by Jaroslav Fojtik. Not working yet.

	check again.
	(DestroyExceptionInfo): Handle 'whence' member. MagickFreeMemory
	already checks for null pointer so don't check again.
	* magick/error.h (ExceptionInfo): Add a 'whence' member to support
	the ability to record where the exception is was thrown.
	* VisualMagick/installer: Install Wand files.

2003-06-25  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	value.
	* magick/log.c (GetLogBlob): GetLogBlob should always return
	a value.
	* magick/magick.c (GetMagickInfoArray): Fixed array memory
	allocation and clearing bug. Eliminate warnings.

	unused matte channel is set to Opaque, and uses this knowledge to
	simplify the math.
	* VisualMagick/configure/configure.cpp: The 'wand' library has a
	linkage dependency on the 'magick' library. Also don't include
	the magick subdirectory so that headers must be included like
	<magick/api.h> for safety.
	* coders/xtrn.c: Fix magick header inclusion.
	* lcms\src\cmserr.c: Fix magick header inclusion.

	ParseEvents funtion.
	* magick/utility.c (GetGeometry): Validate that the geometry
	string only contains valid characters.
	* PerlMagick/t/subroutines.pl (testMontage): It seems that passing
	an empty set of options to the SetImage method corrupts the image
	options (surely a PerlMagick bug), so don't invoke SetImage unless
	there are options to set.

2003-06-04  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (VersionCommand): Add build information to

	to MagickCommand to maintain backward compatability with previous
	versions of GM.
	* magick/command.c: Added flag to tell MagickCommand whether GM is
	expected to process metadata requests. The COM object *always* does.

	Postscript. Ensure that scene numbers are sane. Bugs remain.
	* magick/blob.c (OpenBlob): Recognize the .svgz extension as a
	gzipped format.  Not required in order to read .svgz files since
	the blob file magic detects gzip files.
	* magick/command.c (MontageImageCommand): Wrong exception
	macro was being invoked.  Steps have been taken to ensure that
	this doesn't happen again.
	(ImportUsage): Fix spelling of 'type'.
	* magick/magick.c (DestroyMagick): Decided that initialization
	state should be tracked via an enum so that DestroyMagick will
	take effect even if InitializeMagick has never been called.

2003-05-27  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* coders/png.c: png.c would dump core when writing a grayscale

	Shade method.
	* magick/image.h (ImageInfo): Added more documenting comments.
	* magick/image.c (CloneImage): Don't clone huffman ascii85
	encoding support structure since it is not useful outside of the
	current image context. Cloning a structure via pointer assignment
	causes a memory leak.

2003-05-25  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/shear.c: Incorporate math tweaks obtained from
	ImageMagick which are purported to improve accuracy when rotating
	and shearing using small angles. Also avoid unneccessarily
	transforming CMYK images into RGB images.
	* magick/paint.c (ColorFloodfillImage): Fix hang while
	floodfilling using a pattern image with color similar to the
	border color.
	* coders/modules.mgk: Add missing mappings for PNG8,

	(DestroyMagick): Ensure that Magick library resources are only
	destroyed if it has previously been initialized.
	* magick/nt_base.c (DllMain): Fix contributed by Achim Domma. For
	a DLL build, update PATH during Magick DLL initialization to
	include the directory where the Magick core DLL resides. This
	allows the loadable modules to find the core DLLs, even if the
	core DLLs are not already in the PATH.
	* magick/image.c (TextureImage): Incorporate new implementation
	authored by John Cristy of ImageMagick Studio.  This
	implementation is a full 7X (run-time) or 14X (user-time) faster

	failures. Also ensure correct return value when an error is
	reported.
	* magick/nt_base.c (NTRegistryKeyLookup): Simplify base key lookup
	code, and improve coding style.	
	* coders/logo.c, Copyright.txt, www/Copyright.html: Acknowledge
	and respect the XFig copyright.
	* VisualMagick/installer/inc/files-documentation.isx: QuickStart.txt
	is no longer distributed so it is removed.

	as well as VisualMagick builds. Includes changes for the
	meta.c code.

2003-05-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* www/formats.html: Documented embedded gray intensity images.
	* coders/logo.c: Added the embedded dithered gray intensity images
	gray0, gray5, ..., through gray100 to support bilevel filling and
	painting with an intensity resolution of 5%.
	* www/formats.html: Added description of images available via
	"IMAGE:" format tag, as well as providing a tiled preview.
	* coders/logo.c: Renamed "transparent" image to "checkerboard"
	since it is a better description.  Added a set of tiny bilevel
	images (accessed via IMAGE:) for use when tiling, filling, or for
	use as a texture image.  The complete set of image names available
	via the IMAGE: coder are now BRICKS, CIRCLES, CROSSHATCH,
	CROSSHATCH30, CROSSHATCH45, FISHSCALES, GRANITE, HEXAGONS,
	HORIZONTAL, HORIZONTALSAW, HS_BDIAGONAL, HS_CROSS, HS_DIAGCROSS,
	HS_FDIAGONAL, HS_HORIZONTAL, HS_VERTICAL, LEFT30, LEFT45,
	LEFTSHINGLE, LOGO, NETSCAPE, OCTAGONS, RIGHT30, RIGHT45,
	RIGHTSHINGLE, ROSE, SMALLFISHSCALES, CHECKERBOARD, VERTICAL,
	VERTICALBRICKS, VERTICALLEFTSHINGLE, VERTICALRIGHTSHINGLE, &
	VERTICALSAW.  The HS_* variants are similar to the standard
	pattern images provided with the Windows GDI.
	* coders/msl.c (MSLStartElement): Don't reset gravity if the user
	provides an x,y coordinate. Passing coodinates was loosing the
	gravity setting.

	* coders/modules.mgk: Support the IMAGE: format via the LOGO
	module.
	* win2k/IMDisplay/IMDisplayView.cpp (DoDisplayImage):
	Transparent tile is created by reading "tile:image:transparent".
	* coders/logo.c (ReadLOGOImage): Add IMAGE: format to front for
	embedded images so that adding new images doesn't proliferate coder
	registrations. Legacy logo magick names (GRANITE, LOGO, NETSCAPE,
	and ROSE) are still supported, but they are also available in the
	IMAGE file space (e.g. IMAGE:ROSE).

2003-05-09  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>

	* VisualMagick\configure : Further refinements that support both
	the new "big" library and the normal dynamic DLL buidling styles.

2003-05-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/logo.c (ReadLOGOImage): Added a "TRANSPARENT" pattern
	image which can be tiled to form the background of transparent
	images.
	* win32/IMDisplay/IMDisplayView.cpp: When displaying images which
	include an opacity channel, use a checker-board pattern as the
	image background so non-opaque pixels become evident.

2003-05-07  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/meta.c : Add or fix commenting of DebugString so that
	module does not require Windows.
	* lcms: Updated to release 1.10.

2003-05-07  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>

	* VisualMagick\bin : Brought the MGK files back into sync with
	the rest of the package and added types for meta.c.
	* VisualMagick\bin\win32\ATL : removed config files in order to
	prevent very old ATL project from being picked up in the config

2003-05-06  William Radcliffe  <billr@corbis.com>

	* VisualMagick\lcms\LIBRARY.txt : a define to prevent popup message
	box behaviour.
	* VisualMagick\configure\ : New feature - -t consolidates all the
	coders into on library for the static build in order to make the
	build process tolerable.
	* coders\xtrn.c : new support for BSTR - wdie character data
	* coders\svg.c : put back logic that allows the -size parameter to
	control the pixel dimensions of the output image.
	* coders\meta.c : added support for wide character parsing of iptc
	and 8BIM formats.

2003-05-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* version.sh : Update to reflect development status.

2003-05-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* GraphicsMagick 1.0 Released.
	* version.sh (LIBRARY_REVISION): Updated for the 1.0 release.
	* magick/studio.h: Add fix to avoid problems caused by zlib
	under AIX.
	* magick/cache.h: Parameterized prototypes to make them easier
	to follow.
	* filters/analyze.c: Replace C++ comments with C comments.
	* magick/command.c: For the composite, convert, identify, mogrify,
	and montage commands, make sure a usage error is returned if a
	usage message is printed. This is useful for ImageMagickObject
	users who won't see the usage message if stdio is not supported.
	* locale/C.mgk: Added "UsageError" error.  Added missing closure
	to <Corrupt> tag which caused most/many message lookups to fail.
	* magick/nt_base.h: Fixed a compile problem caused by masking
	internals in delegate.h
	* magick/ImageMagick.rc: Added missing .mgk files.

2003-05-04  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/nt_base.c (lt_dlerror): Defining lt_dlerror to be
	NTGetLastError was not a correct implementation since the
	interface is defined to return a const pointer to a string, but
	NTGetLastError returns an allocated string, causing a memory leak
	if NTGetLastError is used in the place of lt_dlerror.  A new
	lt_dlerror function is added to fix this.
	(lt_dlsetsearchpath): lt_dlsetsearchpath should return an int
	and accept a const char *.
	(lt_dlsym): lt_dlsym is supposed to take a const char *.
	* magick/nt_base.h: lt_dlclose should return an 'int'.
	* magick/nt_base.c (lt_dlclose): Return status from lt_dlclose.
	* magick/module.c (lt_dlclose): lt_dlclose is supposed to return
	an 'int', not 'void'. A return value of zero indicates success.
	* VisualMagick/tests/run_constitute.bat: Add batch script to
	run constitute tests.
	* magick/module.c: Added a ltdl_initialized static flag to track
	if libltdl has been initialized by lt_dlinit().
	(TagToFunctionName): Use a stack buffer for the string rather than
	allocating heap data.
	(UnregisterModule): Report errors via exception info as the
	interface suggests.
	(UnloadModule): Report errors via exception info as the interface
	suggests.
	(DestroyModuleInfo): Only invoke lt_dlexit() if lt_dlinit() has
	previously been invoked.
	* locale/C.mgk: Added FailedToCloseModule module error.
	* magick/module.c (UnloadModule): Report exception via exception
	parameter rather than simply printing out an error message and
	exiting.
	* magick/Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): integral_types.h had to be
	listed *somewhere* in order to make it into the distribution.
	* Magick++/lib/Magick++/Image.h: InitializeMagick must be DLL
	exported.

2003-05-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Makefile.am (magick-version): Perform version.isx substitutions
	via Makefile.am rather than configure.
	* magick/magick_config_api.h.in: Added template header for
	the installed magick_config.h.
	* magick/magick.c (InitializeMagick): Improved the signal handling
	and registration method. Signal handlers are only registered for a
	signal if the current signal handling disposition for that signal
	is set to the default (SIG_DFL). When a signal is caught,
	DestroyMagick is invoked, the handling for the signal is set back
	to SIG_DFL, and then the signal is re-raised to trigger the
	default handler for that signal. This causes the process to behave
	as closely to the default as possible (e.g. generating a core
	file) while ensuring that DestroyMagick is executed. This also
	ensures that signal handlers registered by API users are not
	overridden by invoking InitializeMagick.
	* configure.ac: Added tests for sigemptyset and
	sigaction.
	Add a check for the return type of signal handlers.
	Test for the 'raise' function.
	* www/formats.html: Add an entry for CUR, Microsoft
	Cursor Icon format.

2003-05-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/semaphore.c (struct SemaphoreInfo): Added
	`locked' and `thread_id' members. These are used to record
	if the semaphore is locked, and to validate the thread
	ID of the unlocker.
	* www/links.html: Added link to Nathan Day's MagickDocs
	"ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick documentation project"
	site.
	Added a link to an on-line article regarding the PHP front-end
	to ImageMagick.
	* coders/icon.c (ReadIconImage): Add support for Windows
	.CUR format based on advice from Jean Piquemal.
	* magick/image.c (SetImageInfo): Added missing CloseBlob
	in error path for failure to allocate temporary file.
	* coders/pcx.c (ReadPCXImage): Added support for reading
	uncompressed PCX images based on code from Jean Piquemal.

2003-05-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/effect.c (AddNoiseImage): For gray images, wrong
	pointer was being used to evaluate intensity, leading to a
	black image with noise.
	* magick/image.c (ChannelImage): Return the channel
	image in RGBColorspace. Also properly support extracting
	the opacity channel for images which are not CMYK.

2003-04-30  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/Makefile.am (install-data-local): Install
	magick_config_api.h rather than magick_config.h.
	* magick/api.h: Removed inclusion of integral_types.h from
	magick/api.h.  It is included by magick/studio.h.
	* magick/delegate.h: Mapped out a block of private implementation
	code.
	* configure.ac: Perform substitutions on magick_config_api.h.
	* magick/magick_config_api.h.in: New header file template to
	use for installed magick_config.h.
	* magick/studio.h (MAGICK_IMPLEMENTATION): Added the define
	MAGICK_IMPLEMENTATION used to enable private types, includes, and
	defines in the headers. This supports hiding implementation stuff
	that API users shouldn't see in the headers.
	* utilities/Makefile.am (check): Cleaned up the utilities
	test/demo a bit as well as using the undocumented "tmp:" prefix to
	cause GraphicsMagick to remove temporary input files once they
	have been read.  This leaves just the final output file
	"demo.miff" when the test completes.
	* coders/jpeg.c (WriteJPEGImage): If the image resolution is
	overwritten with 72DPI, make sure that the resolution units are
	set to PixelsPerInchResolution.	
	* coders/jpeg.c (WriteJPEGImage): Don't overwrite the image
	resolution if it is valid.
	* magick/command.c (MogrifyImageCommand): Added -resample
	option to match documentation.
	* VisualMagick/configure: Added rpcrt4.lib to project settings
	for Visual C++ 6.0 so that configure links.  The code which
	needs these interfaces is to support Visual C++ 7.0 XML-style
	project files.

2003-04-30  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* utilities/Makefile.am (check) Change % to %% in -label parameter.
	* www/gm.html, utilities/gm.1, etc. Documented use of %% to convey
	the % sign in -format, -comment, -label strings.

2003-04-30  William Radcliffe <billr@corbis.com>

	* magick/command.c: Changes from 2003-04-19 to free the arg
	list when it was still pointed to by the option arg and accessed
	on an exception. This caused gm to crash on any erroneous command
	line argument.

2003-04-29  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* www/windows.html: Updated to match current installer.
	* VisualMagick/installer/inc/tasks-install-devel.isx (Name): 
	Added an installation checkbox so the user can select to install
	development headers and libraries for C & C++.
	* VisualMagick/installer/inc/files-perlmagick.isx (Source):
	Only install PerlMagick PPD files if the user selects to install
	PerlMagick.	
	* VisualMagick/installer/inc/files-com.isx (Source): Only
	install ImageMagickObject files if the user selects to install
	ImageMagickObject.
	* magick/version.h.in: Added some documentation for the
	functioning of MagickLibVersion and MagickLibVersionNumber.
	* configure.ac: Perform substutions to create
	VisualMagick/installer/inc/version.isx from
	VisualMagick/installer/inc/version.isx.in. This allows Windows
	versioning info to be updated from info in version.sh.
	* Makefile.am (magick-version): For a VPATH build, update
	VisualMagick/installer/inc/version.isx in the source directory if
	it is out of date.

2003-04-28  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* magick/cache.c: CloneImagePixels(): applied Cristy's bugfix
	from IM-5.5.7.

2003-04-28  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* www/api.html: The demo program on the ImageMagick API page is
	usually intended to be an exercise for the reader.  It rarely
	compiles or works.  Sure enough the demo code was not even close
	to compiling, didn't run, and did something totally different than
	described. This is not a good way to treat new users.  Now the
	demo program compiles and runs, and its description is correct.
	* www/magick.css, www/smile.c: Remove "Pair" advertisement which
	was discovered appended at the end of these files.
	* coders/jpeg.c (ReadJPEGImage): Check for failure of
	AllocateImage.  Close blob prior to error return.
	* configure.ac: Perform substitutions on magick/version.h
	* magick/version.h.in: New file to provide base for configured
	magick/version.h
	* version.sh (PACKAGE_RELEASE_DATE): Support setting a package
	release date.
	* configure.ac: Perform substitutions on PerlMagick/Magick.pm.in to
	create PerlMagick/Magick.pm.in.
	* PerlMagick/Magick.pm.in: @PACKAGE_VERSION@ is substituted while
	configuring PerlMagick/Magick.pm.
	* magick/magic.mgk, VisualMagick/bin/magic.mgk: Removed risky
	entry for PICT which has been demonstrated to lead to a false
	match in the real-world.
	* coders/pict.c (ReadPICTImage): Ensure that PICT decoder don't
	loop forever with an EOF condition if none of the PICT op-codes
	encountered result in a condition which terminates the input loop.
	If EOF is dectected while in the input loop a "corrupt image"
	"unexpected end of file" error is reported.
	* VisualMagick/installer: Updated installer.

2003-04-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/magick.c, magick/blob.c, magick/studio.h: Added
	Compilation fixes recommended by Harold Bien for for Borland C++.
	* www/contribute.html: Added text regarding contributing to
	GraphicsMagick.
	* www/api/types.html: Documentation for GraphicsMagick API types
	moved from www/api/types/*.html into this one file.  Types
	documentation is still very much under development.
	* README.txt: Added note regarding the download location for free
	Windows fonts which are kindly made available by Microsoft.
	* VisualMagick/installer/gm-dynamic-full-*.iss: Install
	nt_base.h and nt_feature.h.

2003-04-24  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* www/windows.html: Updated for GraphicsMagick 1.0 and to
	link to ImageMagickObject.html.
	* www/programming.html: Added link to ImageMagickObject.html.
	* www/ImageMagickObject.html: New file to provide some
	documentation for ImageMagickObject.
	* www: Found and fixed broken URL links.

2003-04-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* FlashPIX: Applied patches from FreeBSD.  Bumped package
	version to version to 1.2.0.8.
	* www/api.html: Updated to reflect GraphicsMagick
	* www/*.html: Updated with format_c_api_docs script.
	* Makefile.am (format_c_api_docs): Add a target to update
	the C API documentation.
	* scripts/format_c_api_docs: Add script which extracts and
	formats the C API documentation into HTML files in the www/api
	subdirectory.

2003-04-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* version.sh (PACKAGE_VERSION): Update release version ID.
	* magick/version.h (MagickReleaseDate): Update release date.
	* magick/constitute.c (ConstituteImage): Fixed problems with
	reading intensity (gray) pixel arrays.
	* magick/image.c (GrayscalePseudoClassImage): Use
	ScaleQuantumToIndex rather than ScaleQuantumToMap.
	* magick/constitute.c (ConstituteImage): Use ScaleQuantumToIndex
	macro to scale integral intensity values to colormap range.
	* magick/image.h (ScaleQuantumToIndex): New macro to scale a
	quantum to the maximum range of a colormap index.  Useful when
	writing to PsuedoClass grayscale images.
	* VisualMagick/tests/run_constitute.bat: Batch script to run
	constitute tests.
	* VisualMagick/installer/*.iss: Updated for Beta1 release.

2003-04-22  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* utilities/Makefile.am (check) fixed typos (RM -> RMDelegate
	and removed stray "gm"), added -random-threshold, ordered-dither.
	* magick/effect.c: Random-threshold was not treating non-gray
	PseudoColor images correctly.

2003-04-21  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* utilities/Makefile.am (check): Added code to put logo on demo
	output.
	* magick/command.c (MontageImageCommand): Pass exception rather
	than &image->exception because image may be null, and it is
	pointless to store the exception where it will not be reported to
	the user anyway.
	* utilities/Makefile.am (check): Ported Glenn Randers-Pehrson's
	utilities demo script into the Makefile to serve as a check
	target.
	(check): Add definition to find Generic.ttf.
	* locale/C.mgk: Fixed syntax error in <Option><FatalError>
	section.
	* www/development.html: New file to describe development
	process.
	* index.html, www/*.html: Added link to development.html
	and improved formatting a bit.

2003-04-21  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* Fixed bug with compiling png.c with libpng versions
	older than libpng-0.95.

2003-04-20  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* www/programming.html: Added links to Delphi and Scheme
	programming interfaces.
	* configure.ac : Removed outdated test for jp2conf.h.

2003-04-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c: Add argument expansion and deallocation code
	to command functions which lacked this functionality.
	Replace calls to Exit with a return to the invoking function.
	* utilities/gm.c: Expect each subcommand to expand and deallocate
	its own argument list.  Treat subcommands more similarly.
	* magick/magick.c (InitializeMagick): Seed the random number
	generator.
	* magick/utility.c (ExpandFilenames): Handle tilde expansion
	properly. Handle relative glob specifications. Skip over "*"
	argument to +profile properly. Don't expand VID: specifications
	since the VID: coder will execute ExpandFilenames() later. Apply
	format specifier prefix to globbed file names. Fix double frees
	and rationalize memory management by always copying to a new
	vector.

2003-04-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/magick.c (InitializeMagick): Decided to
	move clean-up signal-handler registration from gm.c
	to magick.c in order to ensure that resources are
	cleaned up for all library users. This means that
	if a user program wants to do something special for
	signals registered to be caught by InitializeMagick
	(SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGABRT, SIGTERM, SIGXCPU,
	& SIGXFSZ) then the user program should register its
	own signal handlers after invoking InitializeMagick.
	The user is then responsible for making sure that
	DestroyMagick is invoked if an unexpected signal is
	caught.
	* tests/Makefile.am (check-constitute): Added
	constitute tests.
	* magick/constitute.c: New test program to ensure
	that ConstituteImage and DispatchImage are working
	correctly.

2003-04-16  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* www/download.html: Added links to directories
	at ftp.graphicsmagick.org.
	* index.html: Add notice regarding 1.0 Beta0
	availability.
	* www/cvs.html: Updated CVS checkout information to
	include the GraphicsMagick-1_0 branch.
	* coders/psd.c (ReadPSDImage): Applied patch
	(SourceForge patch ID 722849) from Derry Bryson to
	fix a memory leak. An image was being leaked.
	* magick/constitute.c (DispatchImage): Applied patch
	(SourceForge patch ID 722655) from Derry Bryson to
	correctly use the switch_map array rather than the
	map array.  Without this patch, DispatchImage does
	not work at all.
	* GraphicsMagick 1.0.0-beta0 release.
	* version.sh: Updated for beta0 release.
	* *.c magick/*.h: Update header inclusion to include
	"magick/" prefix in order to ensure that there is no
	confusion with headers from another package.

2003-04-16  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* magick/effect.c: 4x4 ordered dither threshold was
	incorrect.

2003-04-15  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/resource.c (InitializeMagickResources):
	Added the ability to obtain the amount of physical
	memory by executing an external command.
	* configure.ac: Check for getpagesize().
	(MAGICK_PHYSICAL_MEMORY_COMMAND): Added a test for
	an external command which (quickly) returns the
	amount of physical memory installed on the machine.
	Currently only activated for FreeBSD.
	(MAGICK_PHYSICAL_MEMORY_COMMAND): Use sysctl to
	determine total physical memory for Darwin.
	* magick/delegate.c (ListDelegateInfo): If COLUMNS
	environment variable is set, then use it to obtain
	the screen width.  Some shells dynamically update
	COLUMNS, but COLUMNS may need to be explicitly
	exported in order for it to be seen by subordinate
	programs (such as gm).
	* magick/effect.c (AddNoiseImage): Use IsGrayImage()
	to check if the image is gray.  Add missing columns
	loop for intensity case (oops!).
	* magick/command.c (DisplayImageCommand): Fix
	-dispose option processing bug reported by 
	Felix Heimbrecht.
	* coders/fpx.c: Check status from FPX_InitSystem().

2003-04-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Define PERLMAINCC to be the C compiler
	if there are no C++ dependencies, or the C++ compiler
	if there are C++ dependencies.
	* PerlMagick/Makefile.PL.in: Use PERLMAINCC to compile
	and link perlmain.c.  This allows using the C++ compiler
	to link, which is useful when the build depends on C++
	libraries like libfpx.
	* ltmain.sh: Updated to libtool 1.5 release.
	* Makefile.am ($(PERLMAGICK)/$(PERLSTATICNAME)): Add
	rules to make sure that static PerlMagick is linked
	against the current GraphicsMagick library.
	* coders/miff.c (ReadMIFFImage): Properly scale
	colormap entries.
	* magick/image.c (TransformRGBImage): Eliminate 32-bit
	integer overflow condition for Q:32 build while
	transforming CMYK pixels.

2003-04-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/t/ttf/read.t: Updated signatures and
	reference image for FreeType 2.1.4.
	* (PerlMagick/t/write.t, PerlMagick/t/montage.t,
	PerlMagick/t/rad/read.t, PerlMagick/t/rad/write.t):
	Fix signatures which were thrown off by previous
	change to how signatures are specified to functions
	in subroutines.pl.
	* PerlMagick/t/cgm/read.t: Updated to use reference
	image.
	* PerlMagick/Makefile.PL.in: Perform substitutions
	on generated Makefile to ensure that the proper
	-lGraphicsMagick is used for a static build.
	* ttf: Updated to FreeType 2.1.4.  Now stored in
	CVS as delegates/freetype2 rather than delegates/ttf
	so be sure to re-checkout the ttf directory so that
	the correct files are used.
	* wmf/incude/libwmf/api.h: Updating FreeType caused
	a problem since it introduced a copy of zlib and
	api.h included zlib.h.  Fixed problem by adding
	a typedef for gzFile and not including zlib.h.
	* utilities/gm.c: Fixed minor compilation problem
	under Windows caused by a typo in the signal
	handler registration code.

2003-04-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Makefile.am: When building a static PerlMagick,
	build PerlMagick as part of the 'all' target and
	don't do a 'make clean' of PerlMagick at install
	time.
	* configure.ac (LIB_DPS): Add check to see if -lXt
	is required by -ldps.  XFree86 -ldps requires -lXt.
	* FlashPIX: FlashPIX library now compiles under
	FreeBSD 5.0.
	* magick/deprecate.c (ValidateColormapIndex): Remove
	non-interface deprecated function.
	* magick/tempfile.c (AcquireTemporaryFileDescriptor):
	Priortize use of mkstemp() over tempname() since *BSD
	compilers whine about tempname() (although we do use
	tempname() safely).
	* magick/color.c (ConstrainColormapIndex): Removed
	function since it is no longer used.
	* magick/utility.c (TemporaryFilename): Removed
	TemporaryFilename utility function since it is
	no longer used and it makes *BSD compilers
	complain.
	* magick/studio.h: Don't define _ISOC99_SOURCE,
	_POSIX_C_SOURCE, or _XOPEN_SOURCE when compiling
	under FreeBSD since this maps out a 'ushort'
	definition required by /usr/include/sys/ipc.h.

2003-04-11  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* coders/png.c: Some grayscale PNG images and the
	JNG alpha channel were decoded improperly at Q:32.
	* magick/constitute.c (PopImagePixels): Changed many
	instances of (Quantum) typecast to (unsigned char).

2003-04-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/t/tiff/read.t: Added signature for 12-bit
	TIFF test and a Q:32 build.
	* PerlMagick/t/subroutines.pl: Extended routines
	which are signature based to accept signatures for
	Q:32 as well.
	* PerlMagick/t/wmf/read.t: Relax error values slightly
	to pass at Q:32.
	* coders/miff.c (PushImageRLEPixels): Fix reading
	RLE MIFF at Q:32.  A fragment of old code was being
	used to obtain the length.
	(WriteRunlengthPacket): Fix writing RLE MIFF at Q:32.
	In most cases the wrong scaling macro was being used.
	* tests/Makefile.am (check-miff): Added MIFF tests
	for supported compression options.

2003-04-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/color.c (QueryColorDatabase): Extended to
	support parsing Q:32 hex color specification strings.
	Also add error reporting for failure to parse the
	color specification. This resolves a bug that drawing
	via the draw.c APIs was not working for Q:32 builds.
	* utilities/gm.c (main): Add signal handlers to
	make sure that program cleans-up on exit by invoking
	DestroyMagick.
	* magick/draw.c (DrawSetFillColor): Quote color
	specification.
	(DrawSetStrokeColor): Quote color specification.
	(DrawSetTextUnderColor): Quote color specification.
	* ltmain.sh: Update to latest CVS libtool.

2003-04-08  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/enhance.c (NormalizeImage): Only normalize the
	opacity channel if image->matte is true. This results
 	in some (15%) speedup. While it can be argued that the
	'K' in CMYK should be normalized, it can also be argued
	that this is senseless since 'K' is not a "linear" measure
	like C, M, & Y are, and there may not be any any value
	to normalizing CMY at all.
	(EqualizeImage): Only equalize the opacity channel if
	image->matte is true.  This results in a 23% speedup.
	(GammaImage): Minor loop optimization.
	(LevelImage): Don't level the opacity channel.  Doing so
	doesn't make any sense.
	(LevelImageChannel): Put loops inside switch statement
	rather than around it.
	* PerlMagick/t/tiff/read.t: Added grayscale 12-bit and
	16-bit TIFF read tests.

2003-04-07  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (ReadTIFFImage): Add support for reading
	12-bit grayscale TIFFs. Fix reading 16-bit grayscale TIFFs
	when QuantumDepth=8.
	* VisualMagick/installer/gm-dynamic-full-8.iss,
	VisualMagick/installer/gm-dynamic-full-16.iss: Many C header
	files were not being included in the distribution.  Oops!

2003-04-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* (index.html, www/*.html): Update to new web page style.
	* scripts/txt2html: Update to output new web page style.
	* ltmain.sh: Updated to latest CVS libtool.
	* magick/tempfile.c (DestroyTemporaryFiles): Function was
	crashing if it was executed twice.

2003-04-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/delegates.mgk.in: Ralcgm was appending ".ps" to the
	provided output file name, so change cgm delegate command so that
	the input file is delivered via standard input, output is
	re-directed to a file, and anything printed to stderr (such as
	the Ralcgm program name and version) is sent to /dev/null.
	* INSTALL-unix.txt: Added/corrected/improved documentation
	regarding --disable-installed, --enable-shared, and
	--with-modules.
	* VisualMagick/magick/magick_config.h.in: Add more documentation
	and explanatory notes in order to lessen confusion.
	* Many files: Replaced "UseInstalledImageMagick" with
	"UseInstalledMagick" for obvious reasons.

2003-04-04  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* magick/command.c, utilities/gm.c: Print "help" screen for a
	tool when user types "gm tool" or "gm tool -help"
	* magick/command.c, magick/effect.c: add -ordered-dither option.

2003-04-04  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* locale/C.mgk: Fixed message associated with
	"UnableToCreateTemporaryFile".
	* magick/tempfile.c (AcquireTemporaryFileDescriptor): Decided
	to return a pathname (if possible), even on failure, for use
	in error reports.  The function return status should be used
	to determine if the function has succeeded.
	* locale/locale.mgk: Updated copyright header.
	* (magick/annotate.c, magick/attribute.c, magick/blob.c,
	magick/cache.c, magick/constitute.c, magick/delegate.c,
	magick/display.c, magick/image.c, magick/locale.c
	magick/tempfile.c, magick/tempfile.h, magick/utility.c,
	magick/xwindow.c, coders/dcm.c, coders/ept.c,
	coders/histogram.c, coders/mpeg.c, coders/pdf.c,
	coders/pict.c, coders/preview.c, coders/ps2.c,
	coders/ps3.c, coders/ps.c, coders/pwp.c, coders/sfw.c,
	coders/svg.c, coders/tiff.c, coders/url.c, coders/wpg.c):
	Ensure that failure to allocate/create temporary file is
	properly detected and reported.

2003-04-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/type.c (GetTypeBlob): Prioritize hard-coded path
	over Windows registry values.
	* magick/log.c (GetLogBlob): Prioritize hard-coded path
	over Windows registry values.
	* magick/blob.c (GetConfigureBlob): Prioritize hard-coded path
	over Windows registry values.
	* magick/delegate.c (ReadConfigureFile): Perform substitutions
	for "@GMDelegate@", "@GMDisplayDelegate@", "@MPEGDecodeDelegate@",
	"@MPEGEncodeDelegate@", and "@HPGLDecodeDelegate@" while reading
	delegates.mgk under windows.
	(ListDelegateInfo): Format delegate command line to multiple
	lines if necessary rather than truncating.
	* configure.ac (MagickBinPathDefine): Added support for
	a MagickBinPath definition.
	* configure.ac (GSVersion): Added test to obtain version
	of installed Ghostcript.
	* magick/tempfile.c (AcquireTemporaryFileDescriptor): Open
	flag should have been O_RDWR, not O_WRONLY!

2003-04-03  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* magick/utility.c: Simplified skipping over the "*" in
	the +profile "*" option when expanding filenames.

2003-04-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* VisualMagick/bin/delegates.mgk: Update similarly to
	coders/delegates.mgk.in.
	* coders/delegates.mgk.in: Replaced 'mpeg-decode' delegate
	specification with 'mpeg' delegate specification.
	* PerlMagick/t/mpeg/read.t: Since -r option is no longer
	supplied to mpeg2decode, the signatures must be updated.
	* magick/utility.c (ExpandFilenames): Skip over no-argument
	commands properly.
	* coders/mpeg.c: Removed ReadMPEGImage since this is handled
	entirely by delegate now.
	* magick/command.c: Add convert -temporary option for use
	when input files are temporary files which should be
	automatically removed.
	* magick/delegate.c (InvokeDelegate): Ensure that temporary
	file access is secure.
	* coders/ept.c (ReadEPTImage): Ensure that temporary file
	specified by image_info->filename is liberated before
	allocating a new temporary file name.
	* coders/ps.c (ReadPSImage): Ensure that temporary file
	specified by image_info->filename is liberated before
	allocating a new temporary file name.
	* coders/pdf.c (ReadPDFImage): Change TemporaryFilename
	to AcquireTemporaryFileName.
	* magick/tempfile.c (LiberateTemporaryFile): Now takes
	a 'char *' argument rather than 'const char *', and
	erases the provided filename if it is the name of a valid
	temporary file. This helps avoid errors. The return
	status may be used to determine if a file was removed.
	(AcquireTemporaryFileDescriptor): Decided that adding a
	.tmp extension to temporary file names is unnecessary.
	* coders/jp2.c (WriteJP2Image): Destroy pixel matrix
	after encoding image.  Cristy says that there is memory
	corruption otherwise.

2003-04-01  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* coders/png.c: Use new temporary file manager for JNG components.
	Merge with IM 5.5.7 (mostly cosmetic changes).

	ImageMagick -- Not enough memory allocated for reading PCX
	(bug report by Trevor Willis).
	* magick/magick.c (InitializeMagick): Only invoke
	SetLogEventMask() to set debug options based on
	getenv("MAGICK_DEBUG") if the environment variable is set.

2003-03-29  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/tempfile.c: Include tempfile.h rather than temporary.h
	* magick/magick.c: Include tempfile.h rather than temporary.h
	* coders/dcm.c, coders/ept.c, coders/histogram.c, coders/mpeg.c,
	coders/pdf.c, coders/pict.c, coders/preview.c, coders/ps.c,
	coders/ps2.c, coders/ps3.c, coders/pwp.c, coders/sfw.c,
	coders/svg.c, coders/tiff.c, coders/url.c, coders/wpg.c,
	magick/annotate.c, magick/attribute.c, magick/blob.c,
	magick/cache.c, magick/constitute.c, magick/delegate.c,
	magick/display.c, magick/image.c, magick/magick.c,
	magick/utility.c, magick/xwindow.c: Updated to use new temporary
	file allocation APIs.
	* magick/tempfile.c: New temporary file allocation subsystem for
	allocating, tracking, and deallocating temporary files.  Use of
	this subsystem should reduce the likelyhood that temporary
	files will be left behind once the process exits.
	If the environment variable MAGICK_TMPDIR is set, then its
	value is used as the location to place temporary files.
	* magick/utility.c (IsAccessibleAndNotEmpty): New function
	for testing for file exists, is a regular file, and is not empty.
	Used to test if a temporary file has been updated by a delegate.
	* magick/log.c (SetLogEventMask): Add support for setting
	TemporaryFileEvent.
	* PerlMagick/Magick.xs: Added TemporaryFile log event type.
	* magick/log.h (LogEventType): Add TemporaryFileEvent event
	classification.

2003-03-29  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* magick/resize.c (SampleImage) and magick/render.c (DrawAffineImage():
	Applied Cristy fix for bug that offset images to the top and left.
	* magick/resize.c (ScaleImage): Fixed bug that caused intensity
	levels to be one unit too high.
	* coders/png.c: make JNG support depend on HasJPEG. Remove temp files.

2003-03-27  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/resize.c (ResizeImage): Applied fix authored by John
	Cristy for distortion when using the bessel filter.
	* magick/display.c: Applied fix authored by John Cristy which
	eliminates bogging down when using the magnifier window on
	large images.
	* Several files: A few files included multiple copies of the
	copyright header text due to either pilot error, or equipment
	failure.

2003-03-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* tests/Makefile.am : Removed some debug code which was
	accidentally committed to CVS.
	* Copyright.txt: Add copyright statements to all the files,
	including some apparently missing copyrights.

2003-03-25  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/Makefile.am: Added temporary.c and temporary.h. These
	are not finished yet.
	* magick/cache.c: Transferred optimization from ImageMagick
	to read/write all requested pixel cache rows in one system
	call when accessing the cache using file I/O, and the
	requested columns equals the image columns.
	* magick/resource.c: (ResourceInfo): Use type 'double' rather
	than 'long double'. For many systems, the range of 'long double'
	is the same as 'double'.  On others, use of 'long double' incurs
	the cost of function calls since there is no hardware support.

2003-03-22  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* magick/effect.h, effect.c, command.c: Revised -random-dither
	to require parameters: channel LOWxHIGH.  Channel can presently
	be "intensity", "opacity", or "all".

2003-03-20  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* ltdl/ltdl.c: Updated to latest CVS version.  Claimed to
	support loading modules under MacOS-X.
	* magick/resource.c (InitializeMagickResources): Enable code
	under Windows which queries system limits.
	* magick/cache.c (S_MODE): Fixed portability problems with
	definition.
	* VisualMagick/bin/delegates.mgk: Fix typo in "mpeg-decode"
	decode rule.
	* libtool: Update to latest CVS version.
	* configure.ac: Test zlib for gzseek and gztell.
	* magick/effect.c (ChannelThresholdImage): The is_grayscale flag
	was not be evaluated correctly.

2003-03-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.h (RoundSignedToQuantum): Added handy
	RoundSignedToQuantum macro for munging doubles into Quantums.
	* magick/effect.c (ThresholdImage): Added optimizations for
	thresholding all pixels to white or black. Threshold using an
	integral value rather than a double so compares are faster.
	(ChannelThresholdImage): Threshold against integral values since
	compares are faster. Invoke ThresholdImage for simple thresholding
	across all channels since it is faster.

2003-03-19  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* coders/meta.c: #ifdef'ed out some dead code.
	* magick/annotate.c: #ifdef'ed out some code that is only
	used when HasTTF is defined.
	* Added RandomThresholdImage() method and -random-threshold
	commandline option.

2003-03-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac (LIB_TIFF): Check for TIFFReadRGBATile and TIFFReadRGBAStrip
	in libtiff before deciding to use it.
	* magick/blob.c (WriteBlob): Move pointer increment into
	paranthesis.
	(ReadBlob): Move pointer increment into paranthesis.

	* configure.ac: Added tests for pread and pwrite functions.
	* magick/image.c (GrayscalePseudoClassImage): Properly invoke
	SyncImagePixels.
	* magick/cache.c (SyncCacheNexus): Add back in is_monochrome and
	is_grayscale flag resetting which was lost by copying over
	ImageMagick's cache.c.
	(FilePositionRead): Inline wrapper for reading a chunk of data at
	an offset.
	Cleans up some messy code, and makes it easy to use pread().
	(FilePositionWrite): Inline wrapper for writing a chunk of data at
	an offset.
	Cleans up some messy code, and makes it easy to use pwrite().
	Cache now uses pread() and pwrite() to access the cache if these
	calls are available.
	* magick/resource.c (InitializeMagickResources): Support setting
	resource limits via the environment variables MAGICK_LIMIT_DISK,
	MAGICK_LIMIT_FILES, MAGICK_LIMIT_MEMORY, and MAGICK_LIMIT_MAP.

2003-03-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	MissingDelegateError.
	* coders/pdf.c (Huffman2DEncodeImage): CoderError should be
	MissingDelegateError.
	* coders/fpx.c (ReadFPXImage): CoderError should be
	MissingDelegateError.
	(WriteFPXImage): CoderError should be MissingDelegateError.
	* coders/dps.c (ReadDPSImage): CoderError should be
	MissingDelegateError.
	* magick/image.c (AnimateImages): DelegateError should be
	MissingDelegateError.
	* magick/annotate.c (RenderX11): DelegateError should be
	MissingDelegateError.
	* magick/image.c (DisplayImages): DelegateError should be
	MissingDelegateError.

2003-03-17  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* magick/image.c Relocated misplaced break in ChannelImage()
	and sped up SetImageOpacity by avoiding blend operation when
	setting the image fully opaque.

	critical section if active_semaphore is not already true.
	* magick/resource.c: Snarf resource.c updates from ImageMagick.
	* PerlMagick/Magick.xs: Added missing log event types.
	* magick/log.h (enum): Added ResourceEvent enumeration.
	* magick/log.c (LogMagickEvent): fflush(stdout) at the end of
	each log.  Otherwise output may not be seen for a long time.
	(SetLogEventMask): Add support for "-debug resource".
	* coders/tiff.c (RegisterTIFFImage): Don't register encode and
	decode handlers for TIFF if TIFF library is not available.
	* magick/constitute.c (WriteImage): Fix cut-n-paste error
	in log message ("decoder" --> "encoder").

2003-03-15  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* index.html: Added a link to the GraphicsMagick mailing lists.
	* Magick++/demo/zoom.cpp: Added dashed option support, including
	a -resample option for image resampling.

2003-03-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	be distributed.

2003-03-14  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>
	* magick/render.c Ported Cristy's bugfix to DrawAffineImage().

2003-03-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (DestroyImage): Comment out new assertions until
	we are certain that there are no ill effects.

	assertions aren't asserted.
	* coders/wpg.c (ReadWPGImage): Don't leave dangling pointer when
	trimming list. Don't set image->depth to invalid values.

2003-03-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (DestroyImage): Add assertions to verify
	that destroyed image is not currently referenced by another
	image.  This should help prevent accidental continued use
	of a destroyed image.
	(DestroyImage): Added assertions to enforce that images
	should not continue to reference the destroyed image.
	* coders/wpg.c: Incorporated fixes from Jaroslav Fojtik.
	* version.sh (PACKAGE_VERSION_ADDENDUM): Construct a package
	snapshot version based on the ChangeLog modification time.
	This requires GNU find to work propery since the -printf
	option is used.
	* configure.ac (LIB_GS): Do not test for the Ghostscript
	library by default due to the issue of its embedded libjpeg
	conflicting with libjpeg.
	* coders/ept.c (ReadEPTImage): "PostscriptDelegateFailed" should
	be classified as a DelegateError type.

2003-03-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/blob.c (BlobToFile): Truncate while opening file.
	(ImageToFile): Truncate while opening file.
	* magick/annotate.c (RenderFreetype): Missing freetype library
	should result in a MissingDelegateError type rather than a
	DelegateError type.
	* INSTALL-windows.txt: Added a note regarding a workaround for
	internal compiler errors while compiling image.c when using
	Visual C++ 7.0.
	* coders/jpeg.c (ReadICCProfile): Incorporate ImageMagick fix
	to handle short JPEG ICC profiles.
	* magick/integral_types.h: Ignore SIZEOF_LONG_LONG and
	SIZEOF_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG defines if _VISUALC_ is defined.

2003-03-11  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>
	* www/gm.html, utilities/gm.1, guide/gm.tex: Expanded description
	of the -affine option.

2003-03-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (GetImageDepth): Re-implemented using a single-pass
	algorithm and 1/2 the code. Previous implementation didn't return
	correct results for Q:32 build.  Now it does.
	* magick/command.c (IdentifyImageCommand): For identify, when
	%q format specifier is present, image must be read rather than
	pinged.  If not, either the value 8 is returned, or there is a
	crash due to reading an uninitialized image.

2003-03-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/mat.c: Incorporate fixes from Jaroslav Fojtik.  Close

	manpage for gm, to replace individual utility manpages.

2003-03-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/blob.c: Fix some erroneous log printf specifications.
	Improved blob log messages a bit. 
	* magick/log.c (IsEventLogging): Use  InitializeLogInfo().
	(InitializeLogInfo): New function to intelligently initialize
	logging subsystem.  Only locks when initialization may be required,
	and only locks long enough to determine if initialization is required.
	This approach should avoid deadlocking while logging from functions
	used to initialize logging.
	(IsLogAccessible): No longer need this duplicate of IsAccessible().
	(SetLogEventMask): Use  InitializeLogInfo().
	* coders/fpx.c (ReadFPXImage): FlashPIX library does not support
	BLOB I/O so don't use OpenBlob/CloseBlob.  Opening the blob caused
	a conflict when the FlashPIX library attempted to open the file.

2003-03-08  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Test for libtiff functions (TIFFClientOpen &

	* tests/rwblob.c (main): Add -pause option to require keypress to
	exit program. Clean-up to avoid any appearance of leaks.
	* tests/rwfile.c (main): Add -pause option to require keypress to
	exit program. Clean-up to avoid any appearance of leaks.
	* magick/static.c (ExecuteStaticModuleProcess): Don't bind in
	process filter functions for Visual C++ since the build environment
	doesn't support it yet.
	* magick/log.c (GetLogBlob) Code wasn't actually testing current
	directory for log.mgk, now it does.
	* magick/log.c (IsEventLogging): Eliminate accidental recursive, or
	repeated, initialization of the logging system.

2003-03-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	test failure reason [strerror(errno)]. Also log test success.
	* VisualMagick/bin/delegates.mgk: -DSAFER does not work with
	Ghostscript 8.0.
	* magick/module.c: Needed to conditionally include nt_feature.h.

2003-03-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/module.c (ExecuteModuleProcess): Updated to support locating
	filter modules based on search rules.
	(CoderInfo): Declare only in module.c since use is private to this
	module.
	(GetCoderInfo): Made static and commented out since currently unused.
	(FindMagickModule): New function to search for a module.
	(GetModuleBlob): Moved from blob.c, made static, and re-implemented
	based on FindMagickModule.

	Moved GetModuleBlob() to module.c and made it static.

2003-03-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/Makefile.am: MIFF module does not depend on -ljpeg, but
	PNG module does (for JNG).
	* filters/analyze.c (AnalyzeImage): Bugfix, image should be passed
	as Image** rather than Image*.
	* magick/utility.c (IsAccessible): Don't log errno if errno==0.

2003-03-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/Makefile.am: Link with libFilters convenience library.
	* VisualMagick/magick/magick_config.h.in: Change MagickModulesPath

	-lGraphicsMagick.

2003-02-28  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/jp2.c (WriteJP2Image): Quality factor calculation had
	accidentally been removed.  The calculation is back, but has been
	biased up slightly so that a quality factor of 75 results in a
	more reasonable 16:1 compression. Past a quality factor of 99.5,
	the compression is set to 1:1 (non-lossy).

2003-02-27  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* Fixed bug with reading interlaced PNG images, introduced
	yesterday.

	(BlobToFile): Add logging.

2003-02-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/fpx.c (ReadFPXImage): Removing the input file is
	antisocial.
	* PerlMagick/t/fpx/*.fpx: Replaced with new copies.  Files
	seemed to be corrupt.

	* magick/image.c (GrayscalePseudoClassImage): New function
	to quickly reduce an image to PseudoClass grayscale.  This
	is a fast way to determine the number of intensities in a
	grayscale image. Either a compact sorted colormap or a faster,
	contiguous linear colormap is created, depending on the
	optimize_colormap flag. If the image is already PseudoClass,

	flag is True, then short-circuit the test. Update the flag
	if the test is performed.
	(IsMonochromeImage): If the image is_monochrome flag is True
	then short-circuit the test. Update the flag if the test is
	performed.
	* magick/image.c (CloneImage): Copy image is_grayscale and
	is_monochrome members.
	* magick/cache.c (SyncCacheNexus): If image pixels are updated
	then set image is_grayscale and is_monochrome members to False.
	Algorithms which want to preserve the values of these members
	should save their original values before processing the image
	and restore them when processing is complete, or transfer them
	from the input image to the output image.
	* magick/constitute.c (ReadImage): If the returned image is
	PseudoClass then invoke IsGrayImage() and IsMonochromeImage()
	and cache the result in image is_grayscale and is_monochrome
	members for later use.
	* magick/image.h (Image): Added is_grayscale and is_monochrome
	members to remember if image is grayscale or monochrome.

2003-02-14  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* INSTALL-unix.txt: Document that default quantum depth is now 8.
	* VisualMagick/magick/magick_config.h.in: Default quantum depth is now 8.
	* configure.ac: Default quantum depth is now 8.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Test format types that require a size

	(e.g. PCD) to improperly fail.

2003-02-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* www/NEWS.html: New HTML file for project news.

	* coders/bmp.c (WriteBMPImage): Added support for
	bits_per_pixel==4.
	(WriteBMPImage): Convert PseudoClass images with more than 256
	colors to DirectClass.
	(WriteBMPImage): Do not require 2-color images to pass the
	IsMonochromeImage() test before writing them as one-bit-per-pixel
	BMPs.  Decided to allow this after four readers (including Windows
	XP) displayed the image using the proper colormap.
	(WriteBMPImage): BMP2 encoder was writing colormap using wrong format.
	* images: Updated logo images to GraphicsMagick
	* Added PDF Sages to web page as a sponsor.

2003-02-04  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/miff.c (ReadMIFFImage): RLE packet size was not
	calculated correctly, causing RLE-compressed MIFF images with
	depth>8 to not be read.

2003-02-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/paint.c (ColorFloodfillImage): Transfered fix from
	ImageMagick for the problem that floodfill using a tiled image
	failed if the target color happened to match the current fill
	color.

2003-02-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c: Fixed preview error message.

	Also some cleanups.
	* magick/display.c (XMagickCommand): No longer uses
	MogrifyImage.
	* coders/preview.c (WritePreviewImage): Re-wrote so that

	compute SVG +> MVG viewbox correctly.
	* magick/image.c (CloneImage): Applied fix from ImageMagick which
	is purported to solve the problem that "negative (x,y) page offsets
	did not clone properly".
	* magick/gem.c (TransformHWB): Replace implementation with
	ImageMagick's new version which is supposed to fix a rounding
	error problem.  Hard to say since implementation is totally
	different.
	* coders/msl.c (MSLStartElement): Applied fix for missing break
	from ImageMagick.
	* magick/integral_types.h: New header to include the integral
	types typedefs.  Needed new header in order to include in both
	studio.h and api.h at the right point.
	* magick/studio.h: Move nt_feature.h inclusion to the few modules
	which actually use functions from it.
	* magick/api.h: Added typedefs gm_int16_t, gm_uint16_t,

	specifically sized types.
	* configure.ac: Test for size of 'short', 'unsigned short', 'int',

2002-01-28  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	* Fixed bug in png.c, introduced in IM-5.5.1.  A pair of
	{ } brackets were omitted when logging was added, which lets
	old versions of libpng write a zero-length iCCP chunk.

2003-01-27  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/effect.c (DespeckleImage): Put loops inside of case

	image_info->dither.
	* magick/image.c (SetImageType): For case BilevelType, normalize
	image, and threshold 50% if dithering is disabled.  This is at
	least 10X faster than quantizing with dither.
	(AllocateImage): Initialize image->dither.
	(CloneImage): Copy image->dither.
	* magick/image.h: Added dither member to Image.

2003-01-24  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

2003-01-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/gem.c (Hull): Count down loops.  Might help.
	(InterpolateColor): Pre-compute common sub-expressions to improve
	performance.
	* magick/segment.c (Classify): Implemented idea from Glenn
	Randers-Pehrson to avoid use of pow() when WeightingExponent is
	2.0 (which it is).  This makes image segmentation much faster
	(e.g. 8X).
	* magick/annotate.c (RenderFreetype): For images with
	matte==False, simply set the opacity of the pixel to be updated to
	OpaqueOpacity before alpha-compositing the pixel rather than using
	SetImageType(TrueColorMatteType) to initialize the opacity of the
	entire image.  This is much faster and scales to large images.
	* magick/image.c (SetImageType): Eliminated unnecessary conditionals.

2003-01-21  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/effect.c (InsertMedianList): Assign computed quantum

	expressions in order to improve performance.
	* magick/fx.c (ConvolveImage): Optimized loops.
	* magick/paint.c (TransparentImage): Optimize for case fuzz == 0.
	* magick/color.c (FuzzyColorMatch): Minor cleanup and optimization.
	* magick/locale.c: Added error messages for convolve option.
	* coders/locale.c: Picked up recent changes from ImageMagick version.
	* locale/C.mgk: Added error messages for convolve option.

	* coders/dcm.c: Transferred the apparent salient fixes from
	ImageMagick for a bug described as "Some DCM grayscale images did
	not display correctly.".
	* coders/miff.c (ReadMIFFImage): Reading RLE-compressed MIFFs is
	now about 4X faster.
	* magick/blob.c (OpenBlob): Use setvbuf() to increase stdio buffer
	size to 16K.  Solaris default is 1K.  This should minimize system
	call overhead for accessing large files.
	(ReadBlob): "Manually" copy data rather than using memcpy() for
	very small copy sizes.
	(ReadBlobZC): New method, similar to ReadBlob, but provides the
	opportunity for zero copy on read.
	* magick/constitute.c (PushImagePixels): CMYKA case for
	image->depth=16 was comparing with 8 instead.

2003-01-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/utility.c (GetMagickGeometry): Removed support for '~'
	and disabled centering code until we learn where it should go (if
	anywhere).

	'~' geometry string flag.  This also fixes a montage bug in which
	thumbnails were mis-sized if the geometry specification incuded x
	or y offsets.
	* magick/image.h (GeometryFlags): Added CenterValue enumeration to
	correspond with new '~' geometry string flag.  Taking
	ImageMagick's lead on this.
	* magick/render.c: Transferred fixes from ImageMagick for an
	artifact which occured at the 360 degree point when rendering

	the GraphicsMagick Group rather than ImageMagick Studio.
	* magick/constitute.c (ConstituteImage): Simplified the switch
	statement for inner loops by creating a simplified map in advance.
	(DispatchImage): Simplified the switch statement for inner loops
	by creating a simplified map in advance.
	* magick/compress.c (HuffmanEncodeImage): Test and cache the

	LocaleCompare is not executed repeatedly in the output loop.
	* magick/color.c (IsGrayImage): Optimized loops.
	(IsMonochromeImage): Optimized loops.
	(IsOpaqueImage): Optimized loop.
	* magick/delegate.c (InvokePostscriptDelegate): When using the
	Ghostscript library, identify the library as "[ghostscript library]"
	rather then "gsdll32" so that -verbose prints something useful for
	both Windows and Unix.

2003-01-15  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* NEWS: New file.
	* magick/montage.c (MontageImages): Use ThumbnailImage() rather
	than ZoomImage() to resize montage thumbnails provided that the
	user has not specified an image filter, and the montage thumbnail
	is smaller than the image. This should provide faster montages
	for large images.
	* magick/resize.c (ResizeImage): Added logging support.
	(MagnifyImage): Added logging support.
	(MinifyImage): Added logging support.
	(SampleImage): Added logging support.
	(ScaleImage): Added logging support.

2003-01-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/transform.c (ProfileImage): Duplicate ImageMagick changes
	to image colorspace handling.  Avoids using
	SetImageType(image,ColorSeparationMatteType).
	* magick/fx.c (OilPaintImage): Replaced with ImageMagick version
	since ImageMagick version has been updated to not penalize Q:8.
	Optimized loops.
	* magick/display.c (XDisplayImage): Display to 100% of
	the screen size rather than 90% of the screen size.
	* magick/enhance.c (ModulateImage): Ensure that arguments
	are always positive values.  Optimized loops.
	(ContrastImage): Optimized loops.
	* magick/gem.c (HSLTransform): Optimized performance by

	makes 'gm convert -contrast' 21% faster.
	(HSLTransform): Set to inline within the gem.c module.
	(TransformHSL): Set to inline within the gem.c module.
	(Contrast): Moved to bottom of gem.c module so HSLTransform
	and TransformHSL can be inlined. Simplified conditionals.
	(Modulate): Moved to bottom of gem.c module so HSLTransform
	and TransformHSL can be inlined. No longer check/correct
	negative values.

2003-01-14 William Radcliffe <billr@corbis.com>
	* magick/blob.c
	* magick/blob.h
	Added new stream type flag and support to match with the one
	added to ImageMagick.

2003-01-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/image.c (RGBTransformImage): Fixed bug (thanks to
	Bill for finding it) and finished optimizing XYZ table
	creation.

	* magick/enhance.c: Optimized NegateImage().

2003-01-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* Set some common API structures to 0xbf prior to deallocation
	to make accidental continued use more obvious.

2003-01-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/constitute.c: Minor optimizations to PopImagePixels()
	* coders/dpx.c: Reading the DPX header was off by 4 bytes.
	* coders/(art.c,avs.c,bmp.c,cmyk.c,dcm.c,dib.c,dpx.c,fax.c,
	fits.c,gray.c,icon.c,map.c,miff.c,mono.c,mpc.c,mtv.c,otb.c,
	pcx.c,pdb.c,pict.c,pix.c,pnm.c,pwp.c,rgb.c,rla.c,rle.c,sct.c,
	sgi.c,sun.c,tga.c,tim.c,uyvy.c,vicar.c,viff.c,wbmp.c,xwd.c,
	yuv.c): Ensure that blob is closed on unexpected EOF.
	* magick/image.c: Optimized SetImageOpacity().
	Optimized SetImage() for intializing non-opaque images.  The
	opacity channel was being intialized twice.

2003-01-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/constitute.c: Log entry and exit from coders so that
	coders don't need to.
	* Finished re-writing PushImagePixels() using coding practices
	which may result in faster code.
	* PerlMagick is changed from Image::Magick to Graphics::Magick
	in order to avoid conflicts with the ImageMagick version.  This
	means that any Perl scripts based on the ImageMagick version need
	to do a global replace of Image::Magick to Graphics::Magick.
	* PerlMagick/reference/filter/Raise.miff: Replaced with new version.

2003-01-08 William Radcliffe <billr@corbis.com>
	* magick/nt_feature.c
	Make ImageToHBITMAP function in nt_feature.c compile under Visual
	C++ again.

2003-01-08  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	terribly broken?
	* coders/dps.c: Adding logging support.
	* PerlMagick/t/read.t: Changed file read tests to use image
	compares with a reference image rather than comparing with a
	signature.
	* PerlMagick/t/wmf/read.t: Ditto.
	magick/shear.c: Fixed documentation for RotateImage.

2002-01-08  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>
	* magick/magick.c, magick/magick.h: Add "note" member of magick_info.
	* coders/art.c, coders/fax.c, coders/dcm.c, coders/png.c: add notes
	to format registrations.
	* fx.c: changed default "colorize" behaviour to preserve image opacity.

2003-01-07  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/svg.c: Allow the user to specify the initial background
	color via the -background option.  This is only useful if the SVG
	doesn't draw its own background rectangle.

2003-01-06  Albert Chin-A-Young  <china@thewrittenword.com>
	* ltdl/Makefile.am, ltdl/ltdl.c: Fix compilation problem
	under Tru64 UNIX 5.1.  The GraphicsMagick random.h was being
	included when the system random.h was needed.
	* configure.ac: Improve robustness of POSIX thread API tests
	by including pthread.h when building the test program.

2003-01-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/image.c: In IsImagesEqual() only use type 'long double'
	for error summation if QuantumDepth > 16 and 'long double' has
	more range than 'double'.
	* magick/quantize.c: In QuantizeImage() only use type 'long
	double' for error summation if QuantumDepth > 16 and 'long
	double' has more range than 'double'.
	* Replaced redundant code with macros.
	* Optimize mapping to monochrome.
	* utilities/conjure.c: Had missed removing this file earlier.

2003-01-04  Derry Bryson  <dbryson@techass.com>
	* magick/decorate.c: Use the ShadowFactor rather than ShadowModule
	define in RaiseImage() (bug-fix).

2002-12-31  Cristy  <cristy@mystic.es.dupont.com>
	* magick/command.c: Do not quantize CMYK (bug fix).
	* magick/render.c: Ensure that stroke is not drawn wider than
	requested when antialiasing is disabled (bug fix).

2002-12-30  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/image.c: For TransformRGBImage() and RGBTransformImage()
	round values to int when creating tables rather than using scaling
	to avoid rounding.

2002-12-30  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* coders/png.c: Fixed compile problems.
	* magick/image.c: SyncImage() performance optimizations.
	* TransformRGBImage() cleanup/enhancements. Some rounding issues remain.
	* RGBTransformImage() cleanup/enhancements. Some rounding issues remain.

2002-12-24  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>
	* BUGFIX: Fixed bug, introduced on 12/18/02, in which a misplaced
	 "}" caused an assertion failure after reading any opaque JNG image.
	* Added CloseBlob before returning a NULL JNG image.
	* Merged png.c with IM-5.5.3-1, including a seemingly pointless
	rename of SaveImageText string to SaveImageTag.

2002-12-27  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/image.c: Optimized gray x, y, z, tables creation in
	RGBTransformImage().

2002-12-27  Cristy  <cristy@mystic.es.dupont.com>
	* coders/pcd.c: IsPCDImage() fix offset to test header magic.
	* coders/pcd.c: Ensure that blob is closed on error.
	* coders (all): Pass image->colorspace to TransformRGBImage()
	* magick (animate.c, command.c, display.c, image.c, nt_feature.c)
	Pass image->colorspace to TransformRGBImage().
	* magick/nt_feature.c: Ensure that image is RGB prior to transfer
	to HBITMAP.

2002-12-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/image.c: Re-worked TransformRGBImage() again so that it
	is now smoking fast for Q:8 and Q:16. Changed lookup tables, and
	all per-pixel transforms to use only integer arithmetic. A
	pre-multiplication scheme is used which should actually improve
	the quantization error over using double arithmetic.  It is
	actually possible to improve Q:32 performance a bit more but is
	it worth the effort?

2002-12-24  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/image.c: Implemented logging for TransformRGBImage()
	and RGBTransformImage().

2002-12-24  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>
	* The png codec would close the blob twice (second time raising an
	assertion) if a libpng error was encountered.
	* Sometimes the PNG writer would receive an invalid bit depth from
	CompositeImages(); this is now ignored.

2002-12-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/image.c: Re-wrote TransformRGBImage() so that it
	does not penalize a Q:8 build.  The function should be
	faster now, but no timings have been made to verify that.

2002-12-21  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>
	* Elimimated unused transparent_pixel array in png.c.
	* Reverted to incrementing loops in bmp.c where the counter
	"i" is used in the loop.

2002-12-20  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/command.c: Update MogrifyImage() so that gm is 9X
	faster when transforming a color image to grayscale.

2002-12-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* Updated coders to use VerifyColormapIndex macro rather
	than slow ConstrainColormapIndex() function.
	* magick/constitute.c: Trial use of VerifyColormapIndex
	in PushImagePixels() IndexQuantum case.

2002-12-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/color.c: Added VerifyColormapIndex macro to
	verify range of color index without a function call.
	* coders/bmp.c: Updated to use VerifyColormapIndex macro.

2002-12-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* coders/bmp.c: Sped up RLE expansion and sped up byte-size
	PseudoColor scanline conversion.  Results in 50% speed-up
	when running on SPARC.

2002-12-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* utilities: Removed legacy ImageMagick utilities which
	have been rolled up into gm.c/command.c.

2002-12-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* PerlMagick/Magick.xs: Fixed FormatString() format
	problems identified by the compiler.

2002-12-18  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/image.h: Moved function prototypes for functions
	implemented in code modules other than image.c to seperate
	header files with names based on the implementation files.

2002-12-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/enhance.c: Report appropriate message while leveling
	image.

2002-12-18  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>
	* Sync png.c and fx.c with IM-5.5.3.  "gm convert -list format"
	now includes zlib version info among the PNG info.
	* ConvolveImage() logs kernel info as a "Transform" debug event.
	* ReadJNGImage() now skips decoding JPEG subimage when "pinging" 

2002-12-17  Cristy  <cristy@mystic.es.dupont.com>
	* * SVG element 'stroke-dasharray: 0' no longer causes a
	segmentation fault.

2002-12-17  Cristy  <cristy@mystic.es.dupont.com>
	* CoaleseceImage() properly handles a dispose method of
	BackgroundDispose.

2002-12-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* configure.ac: Updated to substitute for @GMDelegate@.
	* magick/effect.c: Changed AdaptiveThresholdImage offset
	to double so that it works with QuantumDepth=32. Thanks
	to Glenn for pointing out this problem.
	* magick/image.c: Adapted to AdaptiveThresholdImage API
	change.
	* magick/image.h: Annotated global constants and functions
	with the name of the source file where they are implemented.
	This is in preparation to break up image.h into multiple
	header files to diminish unnecessary header dependencies.
	* coders/delegates.mgk.in: Updated to use @GMDelegate@
	definition and 'gm' program rather than ImageMagick utility
	names.
	* PerlMagick/t/read.t: Converted gradient test (which was not
	working at all) to compare with a reference image.
	* PerlMagick/t/jpeg/read.t: Re-wrote to compare with reference
	image.
	* PerlMagick/t/jpeg/write.t: Re-wrote to compare with reference
	image.
	* magick/image.c, magick/command.c: Moved MogrifyImage and
	MogrifyImages from image.c to command.c in order to diminish
	unnecessary inter-object coupling. Only functions in command.c
	should use MogrifyImage or MogrifyImages.  Some work remains
	to accomplish that.

2002-12-16  Cristy  <cristy@mystic.es.dupont.com>
	* coders/jpeg.c: Add missing break statements to fix
	colorspace handling when image colorspace is CMYKColorspace
	or YCbCrColorspace.
	* magick/decorate.c: Cast to double in calculation.
	* magick/enhance.c: Tweaks to equalization map calculation to
	(hopefully) provide more consistent results.
	* magick/resize.c: Use type double rather than long for minify
	weighting constants.

2002-12-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* coders/image.h: AdaptiveThresholdImage offset must be
	a signed type.

2002-12-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* Re-wrote PerlMagick filter.t tests so that they all compare
	results with reference images rather than compare signatures.
	This makes the tests easier to maintain and also makes it
	easier to find errors in ImageMagick.

2002-12-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/command.c: Warnings reduction
	* magick/list.c: Warnings reduction

2002-12-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Updated PerlMagick tests for Emboss, Equalize, Gamma,
	Normalize, OilPaint, and Gradient so that they pass at Q:8
	under Windows.
	* Updated PerlMagick tests for Emboss, and reading WMF, so that
	they pass at Q:16 under Windows.
	* VisualMagick\installer\ImageMagick-16.iss: Ported over from
	ImageMagick-8.iss and verified.

2002-12-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* Major smashing of ImageMagick to GraphicsMagick in .txt files
	and .html files.
	* ImageMagick.html: Renamed to index.html.
	* www/ImageMagick.html: Renamed to www/GraphicsMagick.html

2002-12-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/list.c: Added GetFirstImageInList() function.
	* magick/list.c: Added GetLastImageInList() function.
	* coders/pcd.c: Re-implemented image tile labeling to avoid use
	of MogrifyImages().

2002-12-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* Added 'commit' shell script to CVS for those who chose to use
	it.

2002-12-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/magick.c: Ensure that operating system call error
	return values are never used in resource limit calculation.

2002-12-12 William Radcliffe <billr@corbis.com>
	* magick/magick.c
	Fixed bugs in InitializeMagick, but I also heavily commented
	the code so show what it seems to be doing. It appears broken
	and needs testing on all platforms. Toward that end, I added
	Log events so that we can see what it is doing.

2002-12-12 William Radcliffe <billr@corbis.com>
	* utilities/gm.c
	Fixes a crashing bug in gm.c caused by an attempt to free a bad
	pointer. Added comments to the code that explain why this happens
	so that future developers don't fall into the same trap.
	* win2k/IMDisplay/IMDisplay.rc
	Modified some of the string resources that define supported file
	formats that were in error. One example was eps with had a *.eps
	in the string instead of just .eps. This caused the document
	class to ASSERT under the debug build.

2002-12-12  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* Enable the module loading code for shared/DLL builds
	regardless of whether the build is a "modules" build. This
	allows users to add their own modules without requiring the use
	of a special "modules" build.

2002-12-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/image.h: Backed out arbitrary name change from
	ChannelThresholdImage() to ThresholdImageChannel() that snuck in
	from Cristy's image.h changes.

2002-12-11  Cristy  <cristy@mystic.es.dupont.com>
	* coders/psd.c: Reference cloned image Blob (not sure why needed
	but must be important).

2002-12-11  Cristy  <cristy@mystic.es.dupont.com>
	* magick/enhance.c: Fixed LevelImage() to accept percent
	black/white points (.i.e. 90%).
	* magick/enhance.c: Added LevelImageChannel().
	* magick/enhance.c: Improved Q:8 performance of color
	transformations (e.g. for Gamma) which are based on a mapping
	array.
	* coders/pcl.c: Fixed PCL coder to output proper color PCL
	instructions.

2002-12-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/image.c: Disabled SetImageInfo() code which uses
	GetImageMagick() to test file magic via Is* methods so that
	we can learn if eliminating use of these tests causes any ill
	effects.

2002-12-09 William Radcliffe <billr@corbis.com>
	* Moved xtrn.c from contrib area into coders area so that it can
	be used from within the COM object. This is windows only code that
	provides a back door way for the COM object to have data read or
	written into VB arrays.

2002-12-08  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/mac.c: Merged in fixes from ImageMagick version.
	* magick/magick.mgk: Merged in fixes from ImageMagick version.

2002-12-07  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/image.c: Fix ChannelImage() so that it does not
	destroy CMYK(A) channels by forcing RGB.

2002-12-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* magick/version.h: Changed to release 1.0.0.
	* magick/nt_base.c: Changed "ImageMagick" to "GraphicsMagick" so
	registry lookups work for GraphicsMagick.  Probably should be
	configured via a magick_config.h define.
	* VisualMagick/installer/ImageMagick-8.iss:
	Changed for GraphicsMagick.
	* utilities/conjure.c: Fix unterminated comment.

2002-12-06 William Radcliffe <billr@corbis.com>
	* coders/jpeg.c:
	Modification of JPEG APP1 detection logic to name EXIF and XMP
	profiles as EXIF and XMP instead of APP1. THe current algorithm is
	brute force.
	* coders/meta.c:
	Modification deal with EXIF and XMP requests so that you can ask for
	these blobs specifically if they exist.
	* coders/pdf.c,ps.c,ps2.c,ps3.c:
	Cristy bug fixes to eliminate redundant file access checking and fix
	embedded JPEG support.
	* magick/random.c:
	Upgraded this to match current Cristy code. The upgrade is to support
	more robust temporary filenames in another change to this in utility.c
	however, I have not upgraded this code yet because I don't understand
	it well enough.

2002-12-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* Added build support for utilities/gm.c

2002-12-06  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>
	* Relocated animate, conjure, display, and import functions
	into command.c.
	* Added utilities/gm.c; gm is a driver for all of the utility
	functions (animate, composite, conjure, convert, display, identify,

2002-08-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* Added --disable-installed option to configure to support building
	an ImageMagick which is not installed via hard-coded paths. This
	is intended to be used for the ad-hoc binary distributions built by
	ImageMagick Studio.
	* The UseInstalledImageMagick define is to be used by builds formally
	installed under a prefix, or via the Windows registry.
	* Replaced GetMagickConfigurePath() with the three functions
	FindConfigurationFile(), FindFontFile(), and FindModuleFile().
	* Re-implemented InitializeMagick() to try harder at finding the
	uninstalled ImageMagick without the help of MAGICK_HOME.  In the future,
	it can try even harder.
	* Unix binaries packages (built with --disable-installed) should now
	work using the same file layout as the distribution file.  There is
	no longer a need to put all files in the same directory.

2002-08-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* Under Windows, define UseInstalledImageMagick to locate components
	using the registry rather than scanning the filesystem.

	filename to the text.

2002-08-15  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* Render Postscript via Ghostscript DLL (gsdll32.dll) under Windows
	if it can be loaded.  Only ps.c currently uses this to verify there
	are no problems.

2002-08-14  Cristy  <cristy@mystic.es.dupont.com>
	* Added 16-bit raw write support to PPM.

2002-08-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	and ScaleQuantumTo*() methods.

2002-08-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* Changed configure argument --disable-16bit-pixel to
	--with-quantum-depth in order to make its usage more straightforward
	and generic.  Build ImageMagick using an eight-bit quantum via
	--with-quantum-depth=8.
	* Magick++ library builds as a DLL under Windows now.

2002-07-31  Cristy  <cristy@mystic.es.dupont.com>
	* Delegates/modules are restricted to hard-coded search paths (a
	security feature suggested by Bob Friesenhahn).

2002-07-29  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* Added SubstituteString to utility.c for performing substitions
	on strings.
	* Added support for performing Ghostscript-related substitutions while
	reading delegates.mgk and type.mgk files.

2002-07-27  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	checkmark install option in Windows installation package.
	* Include ImageMagickObject OLE Object for WSH and Visual Basic (not
	IIS!!!) as checkmark install option in Windows installation package.
	* Windows installation package establishes file extension associations
	for ImageMagick.

2002-07-17  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>

	were gray.  This is correct behavior for the PNM format but not for
	the PPM format.

2002-07-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* Load font information from Windows rather than depending on hand
	edited type-windows.mgk file. Still not incorporated in Cygwin build.

2002-06-14  Glenn Randers-Pehrson <randeg@alum.rpi.edu>
	* The wbmp writer would dump core if it received a DirectClass image
	that contained only black and white pixels, because no colormap exists.

2002-06-09  Cristy  <cristy@mystic.es.dupont.com>
	* Label color could not be set (bug report by Ron Savage).

	* ImageMagick may now be built (static build only) using the
	free MinGW development package from http://www.mingw.org.  Leonard's
	"clipboard" coder is included in the build.

2002-05-28  Leonard Rosenthol  <leonardr@lazerware.com>
	* Added new "clipboard" coder for reading/writing the system's
	clipboard.  Currently this is only implemented on Windows.

2002-05-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* Added EscapeText() to utility.c to support escaping text.

2002-05-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* Text escaping for -draw and DrawAnnotation was not working properly.
	Now it does.  Backslash should act as a escape for the the active
	quote character (', ", or }) as well as backslash.  The backslash
	should be discarded if it was used as an escape character.  In order
	to reliably pass a backslash, two successive backslashes are required
	(e.g. "\\").

2002-05-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
	* Modified Base64Encode() of utility.c so that it returns the number of
