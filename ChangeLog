	* coders/png.c: Added support for a proposed new PNG
	chunk (exIf read-write, eXIf read-only) that is currently
	being discussed on the png-mng-misc at lists.sourceforge.net
	mailing list.

	* coders/png.c: Added read_user_chunk_callback() function
	and used it to implement a private PNG caNv (canvas) chunk
	for remembering the original dimensions and offsets when an
	image is cropped.  Previously we used the oFFs chunk for this
	purpose, but this had potential conflicts with other applications
	that also use the oFFs chunk.

	* TclMagick/Makefile.am (AM_DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS): Applied
	patch by Massimo Manghi to set AM_DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS so
	that 'make distcheck' remembers configuration options, and also to
	uninstall pkgIndex.tcl.

	* magick/image.c (SetImageEx): Use PixelIterateMonoSet() for
	possibly improved efficiency.

	* magick/pixel_iterator.c (PixelIterateMonoSet): New pixel
	iterator intended for use when initializing image pixels, without
	regard to existing values.
