2009-11-30  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/enhance.c (GammaImage): Should return success status
	rather than an error status when there is no work to do.

	* magick/gem.c (GetOptimalKernelWidth1D, GetOptimalKernelWidth1D):
	In the Q32 build, convolution kernel size was estimated
	incorrectly for large sigmas on 32-bit systems due to arithmetic
	overflow.

2009-11-21  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure: Update to Autoconf 2.65.

2009-11-20  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/attribute.c (GenerateIPTCAttribute): Returned IPTC string
	values were one character too short.

2009-11-16  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* ltdl/ltdl.c: Update libltdl to 2.2.6b in order to fix security
	issue.  Resolves CVE-2009-3736 as it pertains to GraphicsMagick.

2009-11-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (MogrifyImageCommand): Convolve does not accept
	an argument which looks like a geometry.  Resolves SourceForge
	issue #2890923 "Different handling of -convolve between convert
	and mogrify".

	* coders/mpc.c (ReadMPCImage): is_monochrome and is_grayscale
	flags were not managed properly for the MPC coder.

2009-10-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (SetImageInfo): Fix lockup due to hanging in loop
	while parsing malformed sub-image specification (SourceForge issue
	2886560).

	* coders/jpeg.c (ReadJPEGImage): Fix image scaling when used with
	IJG JPEG library version 7.

2009-10-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Magick++/lib/STL.cpp, Magick++/lib/Magick++/STL.h (shadeImage):
	ShadeImage was the result of a botched cut-and-paste.  Corrected
	now.  Thanks to Jukka Manner for making me aware of this.

2009-10-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/xwindow.c (MagickXMakeImage): If image is TrueColor and
	has an opacity channel, then render it on top of a grid image.

	* magick/xwindow.c (MagickXMakeImage): Fix for CVE-2009-1882
	"Integer overflow in the XMakeImage function".  The problem is
	that the shared memory segment allocated may be smaller than the
	image size requires due to integer overflow.  On some systems it
	may be possible to crash GraphicsMagick (while displaying an image
	file) but not likely to overwrite the heap since shared memory
	segments are outside of the heap allocation.

2009-09-16  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* version.sh: GraphicsMagick 1.2.9 released.

	* coders/jpeg.c (ReadGenericProfile,ReadICCProfile,ReadIPTCProfile):
	Profile chunks need to be concatenated.  Otherwise "chunked"
	profiles become corrupted.

	* version.sh: GraphicsMagick 1.2.8 released.

	array.  Resolves SourceForge issue 2832125 "Crash on SVG
	conversion".

	* magick/magick.c (InitializeMagick): Improve the quality of the
	seed passed to srand().

	* coders/png.c (ReadOnePNGImage): Ensure that opacity channel is
	properly initialized.  Resolves SourceForge issue 2831240
	"Possible alpha channel issue with PNG w/palette and tRNS".

	depth.  Fixes CVE-2008-1097 "Memory corruption in ImageMagick's
	PCX coder".

	* configure.ac: Update to Autoconf 2.64.

2009-07-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (WriteTIFFImage): In some cases, RowsPerStrip
	needs to be a multiple of 16 for JPEG in TIFF so ensure that
	RowsPerStrip is a multiple of 16.

2009-06-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/dpx.c (WriteDPXImage): Fix leak of chroma image when
	subsampling to 4:2:2.

	"subdir/*.dpx" were not working.  Expand @filename to a list of
	arguments.

2009-05-27  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac: Debian stores Ghostscript fonts under
	/usr/share/fonts/type1/gsfonts so check there for fonts.  Issue
	reported by Ralf Wildenhues.

2009-05-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/Magick.xs: Fix Ping of blob.

	* PerlMagick/t/ping.t: Added tests for pinging files and blobs.

	* www/perl.html: Ping blob syntax is like $image->Ping(blob=>@blob).

	* version.sh: Define PACKAGE_STRING.

2009-05-15  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/resize.c (HorizontalFilter, VerticalFilter): When
	resizing a non-opaque image, attenuate the influence of
	surrounding colors based on their degree of transparency in order
	to avoid "halos" around objects caused by colors which are
	transparent and therefore not part of the visible image.  Patch
	contributed by Pavel Merdin via SourceForge Tracker #2792322.

2009-05-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	documentation/Keyboard accelarators".

2009-04-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (GetImageBoundingBox): If we fail to find a
	smaller bounding box, then the returned bounding box is the entire
	image.

	* VisualMagick/bin/delegates.mgk: Remove bounding box option (-g) from
	Postscript delegate specifications.

	* config/delegates.mgk.in: Remove bounding box option (-g) from
	Postscript delegate specifications.

	* coders/{ept.c, pdf.c, ps.c} : PDF bounding box is sometimes
	incorrect or not globally applicable so don't specify bounding box
	when reading PDF files.  Postscript files do need the bounding box
	so make sure that it is still supplied.  Resolves SF tracker issue
	2487651 "convert from pdf chops off rhs".

2009-01-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* GraphicsMagick.spec.in: The module .la files need to be
	installed as part of the base install or else the modules will
	fail to load.

2009-01-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>
