2013-02-18  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac and configure: Check for libpng17 and libpng16.

2013-02-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* www/programming.rst: Add mention of Clement Farabet's Lua
	scripting language wrapper for GraphicsMagick.

2013-02-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (GetCacheNexus): Re-write function so it
	has a single point of return.
	(AcquireCacheNexus): Reduce the number of return points.
	(SetCacheNexus): Re-write function so it has a single point of
	return.

2013-02-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* NEWS.txt: Update with latest news.

	* magick/export.c (ExportAlphaQuantumType): Fix export of alpha
	for RGBA image and depth 8.  Due to typo, was exporting 16-bits
	rather than 8, causing output corruption or crashes.  Resolves
	issue reported in SourceForge GraphicsMagick forum under title
	"CMYK per-channel byte order TIFF crashes gm".

2013-02-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/studio.h (MagickIsBlank): Add macro to substitute for ISO
	C99 isblank() which is not globally available.  Update 'gm batch'
	code which had substituted isspace() for isblank() to use it.

2013-01-31  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (BatchCommand): Flush stdout at key points in
	order to ensure that user sees text when it is produced.

2013-01-30  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/random.c (InitializeMagickRandomGenerator): Use
	MagickTsdKeyCreate2() in order to avoid a small memory leak.

	* magick/tsd.c (MagickTsdKeyCreate2): New private function to
	support allocating a thread-specific data key with a specified
	destructor function.  For single-threaded build, MagickTsdKey_t is
	now type void* and there is provision to support the destructor
	function.

2013-01-29  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (BatchCommand): New 'gm batch' command to
	accept one or more GraphicsMagick commands from a specified text
	file, standard input, or CLI.  Feature is implemented by Kenneth
	Xu.  Submitted via SourceForge Patch #3602331 "Add interactive or
	batch mode support to 1.3.17".

2013-01-27  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c (WriteOnePNGImage): Added PNG48 and PNG64 support.
	Added PNG00 support (png encoder that inherits its color-type and
	bit-depth from the input, if the input was a PNG datastream).

2013-01-26  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c (WriteOnePNGImage): PNG8 support was using
	image->colors to decide if the input image is PseudoClass.  This
	is totally bogus.  Use image->storage_class to determine if image
	is PseudoClass and quantize image colors if it is not.

	* magick/delegate.c (InvokePostscriptDelegate): Only invoke
	MagickSpawnVP() if Ghostscript filename argument is non-empty.
	This argument may be empty if Ghostscript is not found on a
	Windows system.  Report a "Failed to find Ghostscript" error if
	the Ghostscript command name is empty. Resolves SourceForge issue
	#3601816 "Win64 build crashes trying to convert PDF to any other
	format".

	* magick/utility.c (MagickSpawnVP): Verify that file argument is
	non-NULL and not empty.

2013-01-15  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* VisualMagick/tiff/LIBRARY.txt: Fix pre-processor definitions for
	libtiff so that they use multiple statements rather than one long
	statement.  Resolves SourceForge issue 3601001 "libtiff won't
	compile with ICL".

2013-01-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/memory.h (MagickAllocateAlignedArray): New macro to wrap
	use of MagickMallocAlignedArray().

	* magick/memory.c (MagickMallocAlignedArray): New private function
	to support safe allocation of an array in memory with a specified
	alignment.  Allocation may only be freed using MagickFreeAligned()
	and the allocation may not be reallocated.

2013-01-05  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/{animate.c,display.c,utility.c}: Only invoke chdir() if
	path is not an empty string.  Previously sometimes chdir() was
	passed an empty string (because chdir() was not needed) and this
	was ok because we ignored the error status.  Now that we check the
	chdir() error status, some X11 GUI functions (e.g. save file to
	current directory) encounter annoying issues.

	* magick/shear.c (IntegralRotateImage): Limit integral rotate to
	two threads.

	* coders/pnm.c (ReadPNMImage): Limit PNM reader to two threads.

2013-01-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* configure.ac (MAGICK_FEATURES): MinGW static build does not
	build modules so MODULES feature should not be listed as
	supported.  Resolves MinGW test failures.

	* coders/dpx.c (OrientationTypeToDPXOrientation): Return U16 type
	as stored in DPX format.

	* coders/cineon.c: Add support for reading/writing 'orientation'
	setting.

	* coders/mpc.c: Add support for reading/writing 'orientation'
	setting.

	* coders/miff.c: Add support for reading/writing 'orientation'
	setting.

	* Rotate ChangeLog for 2012 and update web page copyright years.
