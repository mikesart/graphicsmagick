 
Items large and small which remain to be worked on.
See website for "wish list".
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For 1.2 Branch
==============

  o Fix Scitex RGB reader to handle files written by Photoshop.

  o Improve performance of Cineon coder.

For later releases
==================

  o Fix polyline renderering (improperly closes shape) when line is very thick.

  o Look into problem reported by Rick Mabry, "Shear produces artifacts for
    a 0 y-shear (e.g. 60x0)."

  o It appears that SyncImagePixels() silently fails if the region
    includes parts outside of the underlying image. The API supports
    requesting areas outside of the image, but then the underlying image
    is not updated. This was first noted with -lat when the image is
    entirely disk-based.
