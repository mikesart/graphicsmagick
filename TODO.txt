 
Items large and small which remain to be worked on.
See website for "wish list".
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For Future
==========

* Fix Scitex RGB reader to handle files written by Photoshop.

* Fix PerlMagick BLOB reading (disable header magic checking if
  already specified).

* Implement DrawableFillPattern and DrawableStrokePattern drawable
  objects in order to allow setting the fill and stroke patterns.

* Improve performance of Cineon coder.

For later releases
==================

* Fix polyline renderering (improperly closes shape) when line is very thick.

* Look into problem reported by Rick Mabry, "Shear produces artifacts
  for a 0 y-shear (e.g. 60x0)."

* It appears that SyncImagePixels() silently fails if the region
  includes parts outside of the underlying image. The API supports
  requesting areas outside of the image, but then the underlying image
  is not updated. This was first noted with -lat when the image is
  entirely disk-based.
