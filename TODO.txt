 
Items large and small which remain to be worked on.
See website for "wish list".
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Short Term
==========

* Update Windows libtiff to 4.0

* -random-threshold needs to have gamma 2.2 pre-applied to the pixels
  for correct appearance.

* Fix browser interoperability issues reported for PNG8.

* Add ColorMatrixImage(), Compare, GetImageBoundingBox() and Distortion
  wrapper functions to the Wand API.

* Add ClonePixelWand() to the Wand API:

  PixelWand *ClonePixelWand(const PixelWand *);

* Add MagickSetResolution() to the Wand API:

  MagickBool MagickSetResolution(MagickWand *wand,
              const double x_resolution,const double y_resolution);

* Add Wand functions to access Set/GetImageAttribute().

 * Verify that delegate-subsystem exceptions propogate properly from
   BlobToImage().

 * atof(), atoi(), ctime(), localtime(), qsort(), rand(), readdir(),
   and strerror(), all have reentrant forms and are not thread safe
   under FreeBSD.

Longer Term
============

* Fix Scitex RGB reader to handle files written by Photoshop.

* Fix PerlMagick BLOB reading (disable header magic checking if
  already specified).

* Implement DrawableFillPattern and DrawableStrokePattern drawable
  objects in order to allow setting the fill and stroke patterns.

* Improve performance of Cineon coder.

To Investigate
==============

* Fix polyline renderering (improperly closes shape) when line is very thick.

* Look into problem reported by Rick Mabry, "Shear produces artifacts
  for a 0 y-shear (e.g. 60x0)."

* It appears that SyncImagePixels() silently fails if the region
  includes parts outside of the underlying image. The API supports
  requesting areas outside of the image, but then the underlying image
  is not updated. This was first noted with -lat when the image is
  entirely disk-based.
