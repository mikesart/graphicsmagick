 
Items large and small which remain to be worked on.

For 1.2 Branch
==============

  o Investigage iDefense issues reported against ImageMagick:
    
    "Multiple Vendor ImageMagick Multiple Integer Overflow Vulnerabilities"
      http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=594

    "Multiple Vendor ImageMagick Off-By-One Vulnerability"
      http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=595
     Does not apply.  Yay!

    "Multiple Vendor ImageMagick Multiple Denial of Service Vulnerabilities"
      http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=596

    "Multiple Vendor ImageMagick Sign Extension Vulnerability"
      http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=597

    "Multiple Vendor ImageMagick DCM and XWD Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities"
      http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=496

  o CineonLog patches from Kai-Uwe Behrmann

  o FPX patches from Mikhail Teterin

  o MPC format related issues:

    - gm identify cores
    - convert from MPC to MPC removes input file.

  o EPT/EPT2/EPT3 formts are not inserting TIFF preview properly.  (still true?)

  o Fix Scitex RGB reader to handle files written by Photoshop.

  o Fix PerlMagick BLOB reading (disable header magic checking if already
    specified).

  o Implement DrawableFillPattern and DrawableStrokePattern drawable objects
    in order to allow setting the fill and stroke patterns.

  o Update to libtool 2.0 (now using development libtool 2.0) if it
    happens to be released.

  o Improve performance of Cineon coder.

  o Re-write metadata handling to use accessor functions rather
    than accessing Image members directly. (done)

  o Update Windows libtiff to version 3.8.2. (done)

  o Update Windows libpng to version 1.2.8. (done).

  o Update Windows zlib to version 1.2.3 (done).

  o Update Windows lcms to version 1.15 (done).

  o Re-write pixel export/import functions (done).

  o Convert to using safe string copy and append (done).

  o Use non-recursive build for Unix (done).

For later releases
==================

  o Fix polyline renderering (improperly closes shape) when line is very thick.

  o Look into problem reported by Rick Mabry, "Shear produces artifacts for
    a 0 y-shear (e.g. 60x0)."

  o It appears that SyncImagePixels() silently fails if the region
    includes parts outside of the underlying image. The API supports
    requesting areas outside of the image, but then the underlying image
    is not updated. This was first noted with -lat when the image is
    entirely disk-based.
