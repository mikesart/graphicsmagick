 
Items large and small which remain to be worked on.
See website for "wish list".
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For GM 1.4
===========

* Update Windows libtiff to 4.0

* -random-threshold needs to have gamma 2.2 pre-applied to the pixels
  for correct appearance.

* Fix browser interoperability issues reported for PNG8.

* Choose a better tile size for rotate by 0 and 270 degrees when the pixel
  cache is disk-based.  Also disable threading.

* Add ClonePixelWand(), Compare, and Distortion functions to the Wand
  API.

 * Verify that delegate-subsystem exceptions propogate properly from
   BlobToImage().

 * Use localtime_r when available.

 * Add RW tests for TXT format.

For Future
==========

* Fix Scitex RGB reader to handle files written by Photoshop.

* Fix PerlMagick BLOB reading (disable header magic checking if
  already specified).

* Implement DrawableFillPattern and DrawableStrokePattern drawable
  objects in order to allow setting the fill and stroke patterns.

* Improve performance of Cineon coder.

For later releases
==================

* Fix polyline renderering (improperly closes shape) when line is very thick.

* Look into problem reported by Rick Mabry, "Shear produces artifacts
  for a 0 y-shear (e.g. 60x0)."

* It appears that SyncImagePixels() silently fails if the region
  includes parts outside of the underlying image. The API supports
  requesting areas outside of the image, but then the underlying image
  is not updated. This was first noted with -lat when the image is
  entirely disk-based.
