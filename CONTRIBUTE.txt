Contributing to GraphicsMagick
==============================

The future and success of GraphicsMagick depends on your contributions.
By contributing to GraphicsMagick you will benefit from the
features/fixes you contribute, can take pride in taking part in the
development of a quality product, and you can tell your friends that you
contribute to the GraphicsMagick project.

There are a number of ways you can contribute:

* Submit bug reports to the GraphicsMagick bug tracking system at
  SourceForge.

* Submit patches to the GraphicsMagick patch submission system at
  SourceForge.

* Perform test builds on unusual systems and report the results.

* Submit ideas and proposed designs to the graphicsmagick-core
  mailing list.

* Create a new language interface, dependent library, or application.

* Join the GraphicsMagick Group as a full-fledged developer with CVS
  commit access.

Regardless of how you choose to contribute, your contributions will be
treated with the respect and value that they deserve.

Becoming a member of the GraphicsMagick Group requires a majority vote
from existing members. Your chances of being admitted to the group are
increased significantly if you have a proven track-record of success on
other open source projects, are a recognized expert in the field, or have
already demonstrated your capabilities and commitment by contributing to
the project in other ways. Please contact Bob Friesenhahn
<bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us> in order to be considered for group
membership.

Areas To Contribute
-------------------

The following are areas where significant contributions may be made to
the GraphicsMagick project:

* Support building and distributing GraphicsMagick RPMs for Linux.

* Support a FreeBSD "port" in the FreeBSD ports collection for
  GraphicsMagick.

* Set up an FTP mirror site for GraphicsMagick.

* Create a language interface using SWIG <http://www.swig.org/> to
  support scripting in Perl, Python, TCL/TK, Guile, MzScheme, Ruby,
  Java, PHP, and CHICKEN, based on a common implementation.

* Create a new utility command parser based on a separate LALR or
  XML-based syntax definition, and using an approach suitable to
  replace the existing error-prone command parsers in magick/command.c

* Create a vector encoder for EPS, Postscript, PDF, SVG
  <http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Overview.htm8>, Macromedia Flash
  (SWF), WebCGM <http://www.w3.org/Graphics/WebCGM/>, or WMF.

* Create an OpenEXR coder based on the OpenEXR
  <http://www.openexr.org/> library from Industrial Light & Magic.

* Create a /pstoedit/ module to import Postscript, EPS, and PDF
  files as vector data using pstoedit
  <http://home.t-online.de/home/helga.glunz/wglunz/pstoedit/index.htm>
  which already includes a high-quality driver to render Postscript
  vectors via GraphicsMagick. This module could also export vector
  data in many formats using pstoedit's output drivers.

* Create a coder to support the CALS
  <http://www-cals.itsi.disa.mil/> raster file format.

* Support reading/rendering HP printer PCL formats.

* Add integrated Adobe XMP
  <http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/main.html> profile support for
  TIFF, JPEG, PNG, PDF, EPS, and Postscript.

* Add a GeoTIFF <http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/geotiff.html>
  extension to GraphicsMagick.

* Port Erik Reinhard's super-cool Parameter Estimation For
  Photographic Tone Reproduction
  <http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~reinhard/Reinhard02/> algorithm to
  GraphicsMagick.

* Finish writing the IMDisplay Windows GUI program.

* Write a shim-layer to allow The GIMP <http://www.gimp.org/> to be
  executed as a loadable process module providing GraphicsMagick
  users with access to GIMP features.

* Port your existing GIMP module to GraphicsMagick as a loadable
  process module.

* Create an interface between GraphicsMagick and OpenOffice.org.
  <http://www.openoffice.org/> so that OpenOffice may load and save
  any format supported by GraphicsMagick. OpenOffice.org offers a
  separate SDK so there may be a number of other opportunities to
  explore.

* Resolve the remaining porting bugs in the FlashPIX library.

* Complete the port of ralcgm to Windows so that it may be used as a
  delegate under Windows.
