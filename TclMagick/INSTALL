TclMagick install instructions.

===============
Unix platforms:
===============

Installing TclMagick in a separate directory from ImageMagick or
GraphicsMagick.

0) If there is no configure script (you are fetching from CVS, for
   instance), try running automake, aclocal, and autoconf in order to
   generate the configure script.

1) Run the ./configure script.  The following arguments are
   recommended:

./configure \
  --with-tcl=/usr/lib/tcl8.4/ \
  --with-tk=/usr/lib/tk8.4/ \
  --with-magick=/home/davidw/install/bin/GraphicsMagickWand-config \

Others that might very well be helpful are --enable-shared.

--with-tcl tells it where to find Tcl - or more accurately, the
tclConfig.sh file that configure uses to find important information
about how to compile Tcl.  The directory where tkConfig.sh resides is
indicated with --with-tk.  The --with-magick option is necessary to
tell the configure script where to get information about the
GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick install.

2) Run make - this should build the libraries.


=================
Windows platform:
=================

* ImageMagick(IM) or GraphicsMagick(GM) should be installed on your system:
  - Check the "Install development headers and library ..." option.
  - After installation the computer needs a restart to update the PATH environment.
  - Windows also needs Ghostscript installed for fond rendering.

* Unzip the TclMagick sources

* Compile TclMagick using MS Visual C++ 6.0
  - Open the VC++ workspace in the TclMagick\win directory
  - Change the include path and library path to your IM/GM directory:
  	Project settings - All configurations - C/C++ - preprocessor
  	Project settings - All configurations - Linker - input
  - Compile the project, the compiled DLL's are in
  	Debug\TclMagick.dll
  	Release\TclMagick.dll
  
* Run the test-suite
  - Change to the TclMagick\tests directory
  - By default the debug version is used: Debug\TclMagick.dll
  - Run the three test-*.tcl scripts
    Resulting images are written to the TclMagick\tmp directory

* Use TclMagick 
  As a library package:
      - Copy the pkgIndex.tcl and TclMagick.dll files to your Tcl-library    
      - Load the library with
      		package require TclMagick
  By directly loadind the DLL:
      - Copy the TclMagick.dll to your desired destination
      - Load the library with
      		load TclMagick.dll
