The `configure' script must be executed to build a Makefile for Unix.
Use `configure --help' to obtain a list of configure options.

Several options may need to be specified in order for `configure' to know which 
Tcl installation should be used:

  --with-tcl=path
  --with-tclinclude=path

In order to build a loadable module, you should specify '--enable-shared'.

The following is an example configure command:

  configure --enable-shared \
    --with-tcl=/usr/local/lib/tcl8.4 \
    --with-tclinclude=/usr/local/include/tcl8.4/generic

Once the configure script has been executed successfully, you should
do a `make'.  After a successfull build, su to root (if necessary)
and do a `make install'.
